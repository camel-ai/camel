- Logical Deduction of Conditions ($C$) (multiple conditions can be deduced):
    condition 1:
        The website needs to have a search bar.
    condition 2:
        The website needs to have a database of indexed content.
    condition 3:
        The website needs to have a search algorithm or function implemented.
    condition 4:
        The website needs to have a user interface that allows users to input
        search queries.
    condition 5:
        The website needs to have a backend system that processes search
        queries and retrieves relevant results.

- Entity/Label Recognition of Conditions:
["Website search bar", "Indexed content database", "Search algorithm/
function", "User interface for search queries", "Backend system for query
processing"]

- Quality Assessment ($Q$) (do not use symbols):
    The transition from $A$ to $B$ would be considered efficient if the search
    capabilities are implemented with minimal resource usage.
    The transition would be considered effective if the website successfully
    provides accurate search results.
    Safety and risks should be assessed to ensure user privacy and data
    security during the transition.
    Feedback mechanisms should be incorporated to continuously improve the
    search capabilities based on user feedback.

- Iterative Evaluation:
None"""
