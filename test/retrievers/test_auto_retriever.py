        Multimodal Language Model Agents

    ü¶Ä CRAB provides an end-to-end and easy-to-use framework to build 
    multimodal agents, operate environments, and create benchmarks to evaluate 
    them, featuring three key components:

    - üîÄ Cross-environment support - agents can operate tasks in üì± Android 
    and üíª Ubuntu.
    - üï∏Ô∏è Graph evaluator - provides a fine-grain evaluation metric for agents.
    - ü§ñ Task generation - composes subtasks to automatically generate tasks.

    By connecting all devices to agents, ü¶ÄCRAB unlocks greater capabilities 
    for human-like tasks than ever before.

    Use ü¶Ä CRAB to benchmark your multimodal agents! """,
