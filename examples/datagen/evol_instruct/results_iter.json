    "A rectangular band formation consists of \\( m \\) band members in each of \\( r \\) rows, where \\( m \\) and \\( r \\) are positive integers. A particular band has less than 300 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has seven members left over. He then increases the number of members in each row by 3 and reduces the number of rows by 2, resulting in a formation where exactly all band members can fit. Additionally, if the number of members in each row is doubled, the number of rows must be reduced by 5 to fit exactly all band members. What is the largest number of band members possible in the band?",
