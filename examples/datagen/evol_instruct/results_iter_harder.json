    "Consider the piecewise function \\( g(x) \\) defined by:\n\n\\[ \ng(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, & \\text{ if } x > 3, \\\\\npx^3 + qx^2 + rx + s, & \\text{ if } -2 \\le x \\le 3, \\\\\nk\\sin(x) + mx + n, & \\text{ if } x < -2.\n\\end{array}\n\\right. \n\\]\n\nDetermine the value of \\( a + b + c + d + p + q + r + s + k + m + n \\) if the piecewise function \\( g(x) \\) is continuous at all points, including \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\), and differentiable at \\( x = 3 \\).",
    "Consider a rectangular grid of \\( n \\) cells, where \\( n < 100 \\), initially arranged with \\( m \\) columns and \\( r \\) rows such that \\( n = mr \\).\n\nThe grid can be transformed using the following two operations:\n\n1. Increase the number of columns by 5 and decrease the number of rows by 3. The new arrangement can hold 15 more cells than currently available, modeled by the equation \\( n + 15 = (m + 5)(r - 3) \\).\n\n2. Increase the number of columns by \\( k \\) and decrease the number of rows by \\( k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer. This arrangement exactly fits the number of cells available, so the equation becomes \\( n = (m + k)(r - k) \\).\n\nDetermine the largest integer value of \\( n \\) that satisfies both transformations.",
    "Given the equation of the hyperbola \\(9x^2 - 16y^2 - 54x + 64y - 1 = 0\\), find the equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. Then, determine the equation of an ellipse that shares the same center and axes orientation as this hyperbola, and whose eccentricity is half that of the hyperbola. Provide the equation of the ellipse in standard form.",

    "A company plans to invest in three projects, each with different compounding interest schemes. Project A compounds interest quarterly at an annual rate of \\(7.2\\%\\), Project B compounds interest weekly at an annual rate of \\(6.5\\%\\), and Project C compounds interest continuously at an annual rate of \\(6.0\\%\\). The company wants the total amount from all three investments to be \\( \\$300,000 \\) after 5 years, with the amount from each project being equal at that time. What is the initial investment required for each project?"
