"""
===============================================================================
The phrase "the meaning of life, the universe, and everything" is famously 
associated with Douglas Adams' science fiction series "The Hitchhiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy." In the story, a group of hyper-intelligent beings builds a 
supercomputer named Deep Thought to calculate the answer to the ultimate 
question of life, the universe, and everything. After much contemplation, the 
computer reveals that the answer is simply the number 42, though the actual 
question remains unknown. 

This has led to various interpretations and discussions about the nature of 
existence, purpose, and the search for meaning in life. Ultimately, the 
meaning of life can vary greatly from person to person, shaped by individual 
beliefs, experiences, and values.
