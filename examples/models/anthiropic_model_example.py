# Matrix Transpose Bash Script

Here's a bash script that transposes a matrix from the format `[1,2],[3,4],[5,
6]` to `[1,3,5],[2,4,6]`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if input argument is provided
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 '[row1],[row2],...'"
    exit 1
fi

# Input matrix as string
input="$1"

# Remove outer brackets and split into rows
input="${input//\]\,\[/]|[}"  # Replace "],[" with "]|["
input="${input#\[}"           # Remove leading "["
input="${input%\]}"           # Remove trailing "]"
IFS='|' read -ra rows <<< "$input"

# Determine dimensions of the matrix
row_count="${#rows[@]}"
IFS=',' read -ra first_row <<< "${rows[0]//[\[\]]}"  # Remove brackets from 
first row
col_count="${#first_row[@]}"

# Create transpose
result=""
for (( col=0; col<col_count; col++ )); do
    result+="["
    for (( row=0; row<row_count; row++ )); do
        # Extract current row without brackets
        current="${rows[row]//[\[\]]}"
        # Split by commas
        IFS=',' read -ra elements <<< "$current"
        # Add element to transpose
        result+="${elements[col]}"
        # Add comma if not the last element
        if (( row < row_count-1 )); then
            result+=","
        fi
    done
    result+="]"
    # Add comma if not the last row
    if (( col < col_count-1 )); then
        result+=","
    fi
done

echo "$result"
```

## How to Use:

1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `transpose.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x transpose.sh`
3. Run it with your matrix: `./transpose.sh "[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]"`

## Example:
- Input: `[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]`
- Output: `[1,3,5],[2,4,6]`

The script works by:
1. Parsing the input string to extract rows and elements
2. Finding the dimensions of the original matrix
3. Creating the transpose by iterating through columns first, then rows
4. Formatting the result with proper brackets and commas

===============================================================================
Yes, there are infinitely many prime numbers that are congruent to 3 modulo 4.

This can be proven using a technique similar to Euclid's proof of the 
infinitude of primes. Here's the proof:

**Proof by contradiction:**

Assume there are only finitely many primes of the form 4k + 3. Let's call them 
p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ where each pᵢ ≡ 3 (mod 4).

Consider the number N = 4(p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) - 1.

Note that N ≡ 3 (mod 4) since 4(p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) ≡ 0 (mod 4), so N ≡ -1 ≡ 3 
(mod 4).

Now, N must have at least one prime factor. We know that:
- N is not divisible by any of the primes p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ (since N ≡ -1 (mod 
pᵢ) for each i)
- N cannot be divisible only by primes of the form 4k + 1, because the product 
of numbers that are ≡ 1 (mod 4) is also ≡ 1 (mod 4), but N ≡ 3 (mod 4)

Therefore, N must have at least one prime factor that is congruent to 3 modulo 
4, and this prime factor is different from all the primes in our assumed 
finite list.

This contradicts our assumption that p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ were all the primes 
congruent to 3 modulo 4.

Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes of the form 4k + 3.

This result is part of **Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions**, 
which more generally states that for any arithmetic progression an + b where 
gcd(a,b) = 1, there are infinitely many primes in that progression.
