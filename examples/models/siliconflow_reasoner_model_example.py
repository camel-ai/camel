The word 'strawberry' contains **3 Rs**. Breaking it down:
- **S-T-R** (1st R)
- **B-E-R-R** (2nd and 3rd Rs)

So, the letters R appear at the 3rd, 8th, and 9th positions. üçì

Okay, let's see. The user is asking how many times the letter 'R' appears in 
the word 'strawberry'. Hmm, first I need to make sure I spell the word 
correctly. Strawberry. Let me break it down letter by letter.

S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Wait, let me write that out: S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, R, 
Y. Let me count the Rs. The third letter is R, then after that, the eighth and 
ninth letters are R and R again. Wait, no, let me check the spelling again. 
Maybe I'm splitting the syllables wrong. Straw-berry. So 'straw' is S-T-R-A-W, 
then 'berry' is B-E-R-R-Y. So in 'straw', there's one R (the third letter), 
and in 'berry', there are two Rs (the third and fourth letters). So total Rs 
would be 1 + 2 = 3? Wait, but when I spelled it out earlier, I had 
S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Let's count the positions:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

So positions 3, 8, and 9 are Rs. That's three Rs. But wait, sometimes people 
might misspell strawberry. Let me confirm the correct spelling. Yes, 
strawberry is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So two Rs in 'berry' part and 
one in 'straw' part? Wait, no. Wait, 'straw' is S-T-R-A-W, so that's one R. 
Then 'berry' is B-E-R-R-Y, which is two Rs. So total three Rs. But when I 
count the letters in the full word, it's S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. 
Let's list them:

1. S
2. T
3. R
4. A
5. W
6. B
7. E
8. R
9. R
10. Y

Yes, letters 3, 8, and 9 are R. So three Rs. Wait, but I think I might have 
made a mistake here. Let me check again. Maybe the 'straw' part doesn't have 
an R? No, 'straw' is S-T-R-A-W. So yes, the third letter is R. Then 'berry' 
is B-E-R-R-Y. So two Rs there. So total three. But when I look at the word 
'strawberry', sometimes people might think it's spelled with one R in the 
first part. Wait, no, the correct spelling is with R in 'straw' and two Rs in 
'berry'. So the answer should be three Rs. Let me confirm with another method. 
Maybe write the word out and underline each R: s t r a w b e r r y. So R at 
position 3, then two Rs at positions 8 and 9. So three Rs total. 
Therefore, the answer is 3.

The word 'strawberry' contains **3 Rs**. Breaking it down:
- **S-T-R** (1st R)
- **B-E-R-R** (2nd and 3rd Rs)

So, the letters R appear at the 3rd, 8th, and 9th positions. üçì
