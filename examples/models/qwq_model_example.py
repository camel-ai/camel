===============================================================================
Let's see. The word is "strawberry." I need to find out how many 'r's are in 
it. Okay, first, I'll spell it out slowly: s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y. Okay, now, 
I'll count the 'r's. Let's see: there's an 'r' after the 't', then another 'r' 
between the two 'r's towards the end, and one more at the end. Wait, no. Let's 
look again.

Spell it again: s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y.

Now, let's identify the positions of 'r':

1. The third letter is 'r'.

2. The eighth letter is 'r'.

3. The ninth letter is 'r'.

So, there are three 'r's in "strawberry."

But wait, let me double-check. Sometimes I might miscount. Let's list them out:

1. The first 'r' is the third letter.

2. The second 'r' is the eighth letter.

3. The third 'r' is the ninth letter.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is three.

Alternatively, I can think about the pronunciation or the way the word is 
structured, but I think just spelling it out and counting is the most 
straightforward way.

Another way could be to break it down into syllables: straw-ber-ry. In "straw,
" there's one 'r'. In "ber," there's another 'r'. And in "ry," there's another 
'r'. So, again, three 'r's.

Wait, but in "ry," is there really an 'r'? Yes, "ry" has an 'r' and a 'y'. So, 
that accounts for the third 'r'.

So, whether I spell it out letter by letter or break it into syllables, I end 
up with three 'r's.

I think that's pretty conclusive.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{3} \]
