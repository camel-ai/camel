Ah, the ultimate question! According to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 
the answer to the meaning of life, the universe, and everything is **42**. 
However, the trick lies in figuring out the actual question to which 42 is the

Keep pondering, for the journey of discovery is as important as the answer
