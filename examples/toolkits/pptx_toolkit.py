    presentations.
    When creating presentations, you must first select the appropriate 
    template based on the topic:

    Available Templates:
    1. Modern Template (modern.pptx)
       - Best for: Technology, Innovation, Digital topics
       - Path: examples/toolkits/templates/modern.pptx

    2. Business Template (ion_boardroom.pptx)
       - Best for: Business, Corporate, Professional topics
       - Path: examples/toolkits/templates/ion_boardroom.pptx

    3. Education Template (urban_monochrome.pptx)
       - Best for: Education, Learning, Academic topics
       - Path: examples/toolkits/templates/urban_monochrome.pptx

    Special formatting rules:
    1. Use **text** for bold text
    2. Use *text* for italic text
    3. Use >> at the start of bullet points for step-by-step processes
    4. Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes for all strings
    5. Add img_keywords field to include relevant images from Pexels

    IMPORTANT: 
    1. First, analyze the presentation topic and select the most appropriate 
    template
    2. Then create the JSON content following the format above
    3. Finally, use the create_presentation tool to generate the PPTX file 
    with the selected template

    Example tool usage:
    create_presentation(content='[{"title": "Example", "subtitle": "Demo"}]', 
    filename="example.pptx", template="/examples/toolkits/templates/modern.

    CAMEL: The first and the best multi-agent framework. We are working on 
    finding the scaling laws of Agents. We believe that studying these agents 
    on a large scale offers valuable insights into their behaviors, 
    capabilities, and potential risks. To facilitate research in this field, 
    we implement and support various types of agents, tasks, prompts, models, 
    and simulated environments.

    The CAMEL project is building the foundational infrastructure for AI 
    agents: collaborative, tool-using agents that operates in complex, 
    real-world environments.

    Our open-source framework empowers researchers and developers to rapidly 
    build and experiment with multi-agent systems. These agents are powered by 
    large language models (LLMs) and can interact with real-world 
    tools—including terminals, web browsers, code execution, and 
    APIs—unlocking high-value applications across enterprise automation, 
    simulation, and AI research.

    CAMEL is already gaining significant traction: over 200 contributors have 
    supported the project globally, our community spans more than 10,000 
    active members on private channels like Discord and Slack, and our work 
    has been cited more than 700 times in academic literature. CAMEL is widely 
    used in research, education, and industry to develop agentic systems and 
    drive innovation at the frontier of AI agent research.

    We believe CAMEL is well-positioned to become the core infrastructure 
    layer for safe, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent systems in the 
    emerging agent economy.
