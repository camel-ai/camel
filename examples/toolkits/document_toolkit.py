    "   - **Title:** Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\n"
    "   - **Abstract:** Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. "
    "We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of "
    "networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. "
    "We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions "
    "with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced "
    "functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that "
    "these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy "
    "from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset, we evaluate "
    "residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layersâ€”8x deeper than VGG nets "
    "but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets "
    "achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st "
    "place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis "
    "on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is "
    "of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to "
    "our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement "
    "on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations "
    "of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also "
    "won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet "
    "localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.\n\n"
    "2. **Document: 1706.03762.pdf**\n"
    "   - **Title:** Attention Is All You Need\n"
    "   - **Abstract:** The dominant sequence transduction models are based "
    "on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an "
    "encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the "
    "encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new "
    "simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention "
    "mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. "
    "Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be "
    "superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring "
    "significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the "
    "WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing "
    "best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 "
    "English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new "
    "single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 "
    "days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best "
    "models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes "
    "well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency "
    "parsing both with large and limited training data."
