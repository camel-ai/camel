Example: Problem Solving with Thinking Toolkit
===============================================================================
The train's total journey time for traveling 300 miles at 60 mph, with 
3 stops of 15 minutes each, is 5.75 hours. This consists of 5 hours of 
travel time and 0.75 hours (or 45 minutes) of stop time. The conversion 
of stop time from minutes to hours was explicitly noted for clarity.
