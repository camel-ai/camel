Post Title: Lad wrote a Python script to download 
            Alexa voice recordings, 
            he didn't expect this email.
  Comment: I will be honest, I was expecting a Cease 
           and Desist from Amazon.

  Comment: Very cool. That is the beauty of sharing. 
           You never know who or how it will help someone, 
           but you post it anyway because that is just being awesome. 

Thanks for sharing.

  Comment: Good job. But honestly, add a sleep timer of a few seconds. 
           This will eventually get your IP banned on reddit 
           if you bombard them with too many requests.

I was also a teacher for 15 years before coding if that's helpful too

Post Title: data siens
Comment Body: I was once reading this article that went as: 
              "The AI already predicted how many goals Cavani 
              will score at Manchester United". 
It was a linear regression.

Post Title: [D] A Demo from 1993 of 32-year-old Yann LeCun 
            showing off the World's first Convolutional 
            Network for Text Recognition
Comment Body: The fact that they also had to know the 
              location of the numbers and that the algorithm 
              was robust to scale changes is impressive for 1993

It's not like they just solved MNIST in 1993, it's one step above that
