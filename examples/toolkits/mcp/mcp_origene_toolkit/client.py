===============================================================================
I can assist you with a variety of tasks related to chemical compounds
and substances using the PubChem database. 
Here are some of the things I can do:

1. **Search for Compounds and Substances**:
   - Search by chemical name, SMILES string, or molecular formula.
   - Perform advanced searches using complex queries.

2. **Retrieve Detailed Information**:
   - Get detailed compound and substance information by PubChem CID or SID.
   - Retrieve compound properties like molecular weight, formula, XLogP, etc.
   - Get descriptions and related data for compounds, substances, and assays.

3. **Synonyms and Identifiers**:
   - Find synonyms for compounds and substances.
   - Get CAS Registry Numbers, CIDs, and SIDs.
   
4. **3D Structure and Conformers**:
   - Access 3D structures and conformer identifiers.
   
5. **Bioassay Activities**:
   - Summarize bioassay activities for compounds and substances.

6. **Download Data**:
   - Download images of chemical structures in PNG format.
   - Export compound properties to a CSV file.

If you have any specific requests or need information on a particular compound,
feel free to ask!
