# 🎥 Video Content Q&A with CAMEL-AI

An intelligent Streamlit-based application that uses the [CAMEL-AI](https://www.camel-ai.org/) framework to allow users to extract, understand, and query the contents of YouTube videos. It leverages CAMEL toolkits and OpenAI models for transcription, summarization, and natural language Q&A.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **YouTube Video Downloader**: Fetches video content directly from YouTube using CAMEL's `VideoDownloaderToolkit`.
- **Audio Transcription**: Extracts and transcribes audio with `AudioAnalysisToolkit`.
- **Summarization Agent**: Uses `ChatAgent` with GPT-4o-mini to generate concise summaries of the transcript.
- **Question Answering**: Ask any natural language questions based on the transcript — answers are grounded in the video's content.

## 📌 Notes

- This app does not yet support chunked retrieval-based Q&A for long transcripts. For scalable Q&A over long-form content, consider integrating an external vector database (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone) with chunking and embedding.
- All answers are context-aware, based on the entire transcript, but may be truncated for long videos due to model token limits.
