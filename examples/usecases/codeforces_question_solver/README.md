# 🧠 Competitive Programming Problem Solver with CAMEL Agents & Firecrawl

This project enables users to input problems from competitive programming platforms (Codeforces or LeetCode) and receive AI-generated Python solutions. It integrates:

- 🔍 Web scraping via Firecrawl
- 🤖 Multi-agent reasoning with CAMEL AI
- 🧪 Code execution and validation against sample tests
- 🌐 Streamlit interface for user interaction
- 🔄 Auto-fix functionality for Codeforces problems

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Solves problems from both Codeforces and LeetCode
- **Problem Retrieval**: Fetches problem statements using Firecrawl
- **Sample Extraction**: Parses and extracts sample inputs/outputs from problem descriptions
- **AI-Powered Solution**: Utilizes CAMEL AI agents to generate Python solutions
- **Automated Testing**: Executes generated code against extracted samples
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Iteratively improves solutions for Codeforces problems
- **Platform-Specific Handling**: Different solution approaches for Codeforces vs LeetCode

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.git
   cd examples/usecases/codeforces_question_solver
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

   ```env
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY='your_firecrawl_key'
   ```

## 💬 Example Usage

1. **Select Platform**: Choose Codeforces or LeetCode
2. **Input Problem ID**:
   - For Codeforces: Enter problem ID (e.g., `2116B`)
   - For LeetCode: Enter problem slug (e.g., `reverse-integer`)
3. **Process**:
   - Fetches problem statement using Firecrawl
   - Extracts sample inputs/outputs
   - Generates Python solution using CAMEL AI
   - For Codeforces: Optionally auto-fixes solution based on test failures
4. **Output**: Displays generated code, and test results

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure your API keys are valid and have sufficient quota
- Solution accuracy depends on problem complexity and AI capabilities
- Always review generated code before using in competitions
- Auto-fix is currently only available for Codeforces problems
