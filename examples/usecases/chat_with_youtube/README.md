## üç™ Using Authentication Cookies with yt-dlp

YouTube may require authentication for certain videos. To allow yt-dlp to access such content, you need to provide your own `cookies.txt` file.

### Exporting Cookies from Your Browser

1. **Using a Browser Extension**:

   - **Chrome**: Install [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)
   - **Firefox**: Install [cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)

   After installing the extension:

   - Navigate to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) and log in.
   - Click the extension icon and export the cookies.
   - Save the file as `cookies.txt` in the `examples/usecases/chat_with_youtube` directory.


### Updating the Application to Use Your Cookies

In your code, specify the path to your `cookies.txt`:

```python
video_toolkit = VideoAnalysisToolkit(cookies_path="cookies.txt")
```

Ensure that this path points to your exported `cookies.txt` file.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

## üìå Notes

- This app does not yet support chunked retrieval-based Q&A for long transcripts. For scalable Q&A over long-form content, consider integrating an external vector database (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone) with chunking and embedding.
- All answers are context-aware, based on the entire transcript, but may be truncated for long videos due to model token limits.
