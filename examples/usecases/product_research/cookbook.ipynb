    "### The ChatAgent: Your AI Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChatAgent` is a core component of the CAMEL framework, designed to manage conversations between an AI agent and users. It supports multiple large language models (LLMs), allows for structured outputs, and integrates memory management, tool calling, and response termination features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Supports various LLM backends such as OpenAI.\n",
    "   - Can switch between or combine multiple models using strategies like round-robin.\n",
    "   - Handles both synchronous and asynchronous model calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Management**:\n",
    "   - Maintains conversation history using `AgentMemory`.\n",
    "   - Automatically manages context length based on token limits or message window size.\n",
    "   - Allows saving/loading of memory from JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**:\n",
    "   - Supports internal function tools (e.g., calculators, search APIs).\n",
    "   - Allows external tools to be defined, which are not processed by the agent but passed through.\n",
    "   - Records tool call history with inputs, outputs, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structured Output**:\n",
    "   - Accepts Pydantic model classes to enforce structured responses (e.g., JSON format).\n",
    "   - Tries to reformat invalid responses to match the desired schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Termination Control**:\n",
    "   - Integrates `ResponseTerminator` objects to control when the agent should stop responding.\n",
    "   - Supports manual termination via event flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Multi-turn Conversations**:\n",
    "   - Manages complex dialogues with multi-step interactions.\n",
    "   - Handles streaming responses from models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **MCP Protocol Support**:\n",
    "   - Can expose itself as an MCP server to integrate with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's ideal for applications such as chatbots, intelligent assistants, and automated agents in research or enterprise environments."

    "### RolePlaying: Collaborative Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RolePlaying` class enables two AI agents to simulate a conversation, where one acts as an assistant and the other as a user. It is commonly used for simulating interactions between humans and AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Role Simulation:**  \n",
    "- Simulates conversations between two roles (e.g., \"assistant\" and \"user\").\n",
    "- Each role is managed by a `ChatAgent`, capable of understanding context and generating natural language responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Task Specification & Planning:**  \n",
    "- **Task Specify Agent**: Makes the task prompt more specific or detailed.  \n",
    "- **Task Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex tasks into multiple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Critic Evaluation (Optional):**  \n",
    "- A `CriticAgent` or human reviewer can be introduced to evaluate the quality of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Multi-Model Support:**  \n",
    "- Supports various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,DeepSeeek).\n",
    "- Allows unified or separate model configurations for each role.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Memory:**  \n",
    "- the memory system is a core module used to store and manage conversation history and context information . It plays a critical role in enabling AI agents to maintain coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case:\n",
    "Imagine you're developing a customer service chatbot. You can use `RolePlaying` to simulate a conversation between a \"customer\" and a \"support agent\" to test how well the bot handles different queries. A critic (either AI or human) can then assess whether the responses are accurate and helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, `RolePlaying` is a powerful  for leveraging AI agents to interact with each other and solve complex problems."

It returns the path to the downloaded file. If the file is\\nsuccessfully downloaded, you can stop the simulation and report the path to\\nthe downloaded file for further processing.\\n5. `scroll_to_bottom()`: Scroll to the bottom of the page.\\n6. `scroll_to_top()`: Scroll to the top of the page.\\n7. `scroll_up()`: Scroll up the page. It is suitable when you want to see the\\nelements above the current viewport.\\n8. `scroll_down()`: Scroll down the page. It is suitable when you want to see\\nthe elements below the current viewport. If the webpage does not change, It\\nmeans that the webpage has scrolled to the bottom.\\n9. `back()`: Navigate back to the previous page. This is useful when you want\\nto go back to the previous page, as current page is not useful.\\n10. `stop()`: Stop the action process, because the task is completed or failed\\n(impossible to find the answer). In this situation, you should provide your\\nanswer in your output.\\n11. `get_url()`: Get the current URL of the current page.\\n12. `find_text_on_page(search_text: str)`: Find the next given text on the\\ncurrent whole page, and scroll the page to the targeted text. It is equivalent\\nto pressing Ctrl + F and searching for the text, and is powerful when you want\\nto fast-check whether the current page contains some specific text.\\n13. `visit_page(url: str)`: Go to the specific url page.\\n14. `click_blank_area()`: Click a blank area of the page to unfocus the\\ncurrent element. It is useful when you have clicked an element but it cannot\\nunfocus itself (e.g. Menu bar) to automatically render the updated webpage.\\n15. `ask_question_about_video(question: str)`: Ask a question about the\\ncurrent webpage which contains video, e.g. youtube websites.\\n\\n\\nHere are the latest 5 trajectory (at most) you have taken:\\n<history>\\n[]\\n</history>\\n\\nYour output should be in json format, including the following fields:\\n- `observation`: The detailed image description about the current viewport. Do\\nnot over-confident about the correctness of the history actions. You should\\nalways check the current viewport to make sure the correctness of the next\\naction.\\n- `reasoning`: The reasoning about the next action you want to take, and the\\npossible obstacles you may encounter, and how to solve them. Do not forget to\\ncheck the history actions to avoid the same mistakes.\\n- `action_code`: The action code you want to take. It is only one step action\\ncode, without any other texts (such as annotation)\\n\\nHere is two example of the output:\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"observation\": [IMAGE_DESCRIPTION],\\n    \"reasoning\": [YOUR_REASONING],\\n    \"action_code\": \"fill_input_id([ID], [TEXT])\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n    \"observation\":  \"The current page is a CAPTCHA verification page on Amazon. It asks the user to ..\",\\n    \"reasoning\": \"To proceed with the task of searching for products, I need to complete..\",\\n    \"action_code\": \"fill_input_id(3, \\'AUXPMR\\')\"\\n}\\n\\nHere are some tips for you:\\n- Never forget the overall question: **Conduct a detailed analysis of the OWL project on GitHub to understand its features, potential use cases, and current limitations.**\\n- Maybe after a certain operation (e.g. click_id), the page content has not\\nchanged. You can check whether the action step is successful by looking at the\\n`success` of the action step in the history. If successful, it means that the\\npage content is indeed the same after the click. You need to try other methods.\\n- If using one way to solve the problem is not successful, try other ways.\\nMake sure your provided ID is correct!\\n- Some cases are very complex and need to be achieve by an iterative process.\\nYou can use the `back()` function to go back to the previous page to try other\\nmethods.\\n- There are many links on the page, which may be useful for solving the\\nproblem. You can use the `click_id()` function to click on the link to see if\\nit is useful.\\n- Always keep in mind that your action must be based on the ID shown in the\\ncurrent image or viewport, not the ID shown in the history.\\n- Do not use `stop()` lightly. Always remind yourself that the image only\\nshows a part of the full page. If you cannot find the answer, try to use\\nfunctions like `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` to check the full content of\\nthe webpage before doing anything else, because the answer or next key step\\nmay be hidden in the content below.\\n- If the webpage needs human verification, you must avoid processing it.\\nPlease use `back()` to go back to the previous page, and try other ways.\\n- If you have tried everything and still cannot resolve the issue, please stop\\nthe simulation, and report issues you have encountered.\\n- Check the history actions carefully, detect whether you have repeatedly made\\nthe same actions or not.\\n- When dealing with wikipedia revision history related tasks, you need to\\nthink about the solution flexibly. First, adjust the browsing history\\ndisplayed on a single page to the maximum, and then make use of the\\nfind_text_on_page function. This is extremely useful which can quickly locate\\nthe text you want to find and skip massive amount of useless information.\\n- Flexibly use interactive elements like slide down selection bar to filter\\nout the information you need.

You can check whether the action step is successful by looking at the\\n`success` of the action step in the history. If successful, it means that the\\npage content is indeed the same after the click. You need to try other methods.\\n- If using one way to solve the problem is not successful, try other ways.\\nMake sure your provided ID is correct!\\n- Some cases are very complex and need to be achieve by an iterative process.\\nYou can use the `back()` function to go back to the previous page to try other\\nmethods.\\n- There are many links on the page, which may be useful for solving the\\nproblem. You can use the `click_id()` function to click on the link to see if\\nit is useful.\\n- Always keep in mind that your action must be based on the ID shown in the\\ncurrent image or viewport, not the ID shown in the history.\\n- Do not use `stop()` lightly. Always remind yourself that the image only\\nshows a part of the full page. If you cannot find the answer, try to use\\nfunctions like `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` to check the full content of\\nthe webpage before doing anything else, because the answer or next key step\\nmay be hidden in the content below.\\n- If the webpage needs human verification, you must avoid processing it.\\nPlease use `back()` to go back to the previous page, and try other ways.\\n- If you have tried everything and still cannot resolve the issue, please stop\\nthe simulation, and report issues you have encountered.\\n- Check the history actions carefully, detect whether you have repeatedly made\\nthe same actions or not.\\n- When dealing with wikipedia revision history related tasks, you need to\\nthink about the solution flexibly. First, adjust the browsing history\\ndisplayed on a single page to the maximum, and then make use of the\\nfind_text_on_page function. This is extremely useful which can quickly locate\\nthe text you want to find and skip massive amount of useless information.\\n- Flexibly use interactive elements like slide down selection bar to filter\\nout the information you need. Sometimes they are extremely useful.\\n```\\n        '}, {'type': 'image_url', 'image_url': {'url': 'file:///var/folders/2q/_bzfv_vn0lngh7kmv0q_3rm00000gn/T/image_e25f48bc91.png', 'detail': 'auto'}}]}]\n",

This involves understanding the project\\'s features, identifying potential use cases, and recognizing any current limitations. The analysis will require navigating through the project\\'s GitHub repository to gather relevant information.\\n\\n### Detailed Plan\\n\\n1. **Visit the GitHub Repository:**\\n   - Open a web browser and navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/camel-ai/owl`.\\n\\n2. **Read the Repository Overview:**\\n   - Start by reading the README file, which is typically displayed on the main page of the repository. This file often contains a summary of the project, its purpose, and key features.\\n\\n3. **Identify Features:**\\n   - Look for sections in the README or other documentation files that list the features of the OWL project. These might be bullet points or detailed descriptions.\\n   - Check for any diagrams, screenshots, or examples that illustrate the features.\\n\\n4. **Explore Use Cases:**\\n   - Search for any mention of use cases in the README or other documentation files. This might include specific scenarios or industries where the OWL project can be applied.\\n   - Look for any case studies or examples provided in the documentation or linked resources.\\n\\n5. **Review Limitations:**\\n   - Look for a section on known issues or limitations. This might be in the README, a separate documentation file, or the \"Issues\" tab.\\n   - Check the \"Issues\" tab for open and closed issues that might highlight limitations or areas for improvement.\\n\\n6. **Examine the Codebase:**\\n   - Browse through the code to understand the structure and implementation. This can provide insights into the project\\'s capabilities and limitations.\\n   - Look for comments or documentation within the code that explain complex parts or highlight limitations.\\n\\n7. **Check the Wiki or Additional Documentation:**\\n   - If the repository has a Wiki or additional documentation, explore these resources for more detailed information about features, use cases, and limitations.\\n\\n8. **Review the Project\\'s Activity:**\\n   - Check the \"Commits\" tab to see the frequency and recency of updates, which can indicate the project\\'s activity level.\\n   - Look at the \"Pull Requests\" tab to see ongoing or recent contributions, which might also highlight new features or fixes.\\n\\n9. **Analyze Community and Support:**\\n   - Review the \"Discussions\" or \"Issues\" tabs to gauge community engagement and support. This can provide insights into common questions or challenges faced by users.\\n\\n10. **Summarize Findings:**\\n    - Compile the information gathered into a detailed analysis, summarizing the features, potential use cases, and current limitations of the OWL project.\\n\\nBy following this plan, you can systematically gather and analyze information about the OWL project on GitHub, while being mindful of the partially observable nature of the task.<detailed_plan>\\n        \\n\\nHere are the current available browser functions you can use:\\n\\n1. `fill_input_id(identifier: Union[str, int], text: str)`: Fill an input\\nfield (e.g. search box) with the given text and press Enter.\\n2. `click_id(identifier: Union[str, int])`: Click an element with the given ID.\\n3. `hover_id(identifier: Union[str, int])`: Hover over an element with the\\ngiven ID.\\n4. `download_file_id(identifier: Union[str, int])`: Download a file with the\\ngiven ID. It returns the path to the downloaded file. If the file is\\nsuccessfully downloaded, you can stop the simulation and report the path to\\nthe downloaded file for further processing.\\n5. `scroll_to_bottom()`: Scroll to the bottom of the page.\\n6. `scroll_to_top()`: Scroll to the top of the page.\\n7. `scroll_up()`: Scroll up the page. It is suitable when you want to see the\\nelements above the current viewport.\\n8. `scroll_down()`: Scroll down the page. It is suitable when you want to see\\nthe elements below the current viewport. If the webpage does not change, It\\nmeans that the webpage has scrolled to the bottom.\\n9. `back()`: Navigate back to the previous page. This is useful when you want\\nto go back to the previous page, as current page is not useful.\\n10. `stop()`: Stop the action process, because the task is completed or failed\\n(impossible to find the answer). In this situation, you should provide your\\nanswer in your output.\\n11. `get_url()`: Get the current URL of the current page.\\n12. `find_text_on_page(search_text: str)`: Find the next given text on the\\ncurrent whole page, and scroll the page to the targeted text. It is equivalent\\nto pressing Ctrl + F and searching for the text, and is powerful when you want\\nto fast-check whether the current page contains some specific text.\\n13. `visit_page(url: str)`: Go to the specific url page.\\n14. `click_blank_area()`: Click a blank area of the page to unfocus the\\ncurrent element. It is useful when you have clicked an element but it cannot\\nunfocus itself (e.g. Menu bar) to automatically render the updated webpage.\\n15. `ask_question_about_video(question: str)`: Ask a question about the\\ncurrent webpage which contains video, e.g. youtube websites.\\n\\n\\nHere are the latest 5 trajectory (at most) you have taken:\\n<history>\\n[{\\'round\\': 0, \\'observation\\': \"The current viewport shows the GitHub repository page for the OWL project.

You should\\nalways check the current viewport to make sure the correctness of the next\\naction.\\n- `reasoning`: The reasoning about the next action you want to take, and the\\npossible obstacles you may encounter, and how to solve them. Do not forget to\\ncheck the history actions to avoid the same mistakes.\\n- `action_code`: The action code you want to take. It is only one step action\\ncode, without any other texts (such as annotation)\\n\\nHere is two example of the output:\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"observation\": [IMAGE_DESCRIPTION],\\n    \"reasoning\": [YOUR_REASONING],\\n    \"action_code\": \"fill_input_id([ID], [TEXT])\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n    \"observation\":  \"The current page is a CAPTCHA verification page on Amazon. It asks the user to ..\",\\n    \"reasoning\": \"To proceed with the task of searching for products, I need to complete..\",\\n    \"action_code\": \"fill_input_id(3, \\'AUXPMR\\')\"\\n}\\n\\nHere are some tips for you:\\n- Never forget the overall question: **Conduct a detailed analysis of the OWL project on GitHub to understand its features, potential use cases, and current limitations.**\\n- Maybe after a certain operation (e.g. click_id), the page content has not\\nchanged. You can check whether the action step is successful by looking at the\\n`success` of the action step in the history. If successful, it means that the\\npage content is indeed the same after the click. You need to try other methods.\\n- If using one way to solve the problem is not successful, try other ways.\\nMake sure your provided ID is correct!\\n- Some cases are very complex and need to be achieve by an iterative process.\\nYou can use the `back()` function to go back to the previous page to try other\\nmethods.\\n- There are many links on the page, which may be useful for solving the\\nproblem. You can use the `click_id()` function to click on the link to see if\\nit is useful.\\n- Always keep in mind that your action must be based on the ID shown in the\\ncurrent image or viewport, not the ID shown in the history.\\n- Do not use `stop()` lightly. Always remind yourself that the image only\\nshows a part of the full page. If you cannot find the answer, try to use\\nfunctions like `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` to check the full content of\\nthe webpage before doing anything else, because the answer or next key step\\nmay be hidden in the content below.\\n- If the webpage needs human verification, you must avoid processing it.\\nPlease use `back()` to go back to the previous page, and try other ways.\\n- If you have tried everything and still cannot resolve the issue, please stop\\nthe simulation, and report issues you have encountered.\\n- Check the history actions carefully, detect whether you have repeatedly made\\nthe same actions or not.\\n- When dealing with wikipedia revision history related tasks, you need to\\nthink about the solution flexibly. First, adjust the browsing history\\ndisplayed on a single page to the maximum, and then make use of the\\nfind_text_on_page function. This is extremely useful which can quickly locate\\nthe text you want to find and skip massive amount of useless information.\\n- Flexibly use interactive elements like slide down selection bar to filter\\nout the information you need. Sometimes they are extremely useful.\\n```\\n        '}, {'type': 'image_url', 'image_url': {'url': 'file:///var/folders/2q/_bzfv_vn0lngh7kmv0q_3rm00000gn/T/image_84e401e2ff.png', 'detail': 'auto'}}]}]\n",

You can check whether the action step is successful by looking at the\\n`success` of the action step in the history. If successful, it means that the\\npage content is indeed the same after the click. You need to try other methods.\\n- If using one way to solve the problem is not successful, try other ways.\\nMake sure your provided ID is correct!\\n- Some cases are very complex and need to be achieve by an iterative process.\\nYou can use the `back()` function to go back to the previous page to try other\\nmethods.\\n- There are many links on the page, which may be useful for solving the\\nproblem. You can use the `click_id()` function to click on the link to see if\\nit is useful.\\n- Always keep in mind that your action must be based on the ID shown in the\\ncurrent image or viewport, not the ID shown in the history.\\n- Do not use `stop()` lightly. Always remind yourself that the image only\\nshows a part of the full page. If you cannot find the answer, try to use\\nfunctions like `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` to check the full content of\\nthe webpage before doing anything else, because the answer or next key step\\nmay be hidden in the content below.\\n- If the webpage needs human verification, you must avoid processing it.\\nPlease use `back()` to go back to the previous page, and try other ways.\\n- If you have tried everything and still cannot resolve the issue, please stop\\nthe simulation, and report issues you have encountered.\\n- Check the history actions carefully, detect whether you have repeatedly made\\nthe same actions or not.\\n- When dealing with wikipedia revision history related tasks, you need to\\nthink about the solution flexibly. First, adjust the browsing history\\ndisplayed on a single page to the maximum, and then make use of the\\nfind_text_on_page function. This is extremely useful which can quickly locate\\nthe text you want to find and skip massive amount of useless information.\\n- Flexibly use interactive elements like slide down selection bar to filter\\nout the information you need. Sometimes they are extremely useful.\\n```\\n        '}, {'type': 'image_url', 'image_url': {'url': 'file:///var/folders/2q/_bzfv_vn0lngh7kmv0q_3rm00000gn/T/image_84e401e2ff.png', 'detail': 'auto'}}]}]\n",

This involves understanding the project\\'s features, identifying potential use cases, and recognizing any current limitations. The analysis will require navigating through the project\\'s GitHub repository to gather relevant information.\\n\\n### Detailed Plan\\n\\n1. **Visit the GitHub Repository:**\\n   - Open a web browser and navigate to the URL: `https://github.com/camel-ai/owl`.\\n\\n2. **Read the Repository Overview:**\\n   - Start by reading the README file, which is typically displayed on the main page of the repository. This file often contains a summary of the project, its purpose, and key features.\\n\\n3. **Identify Features:**\\n   - Look for sections in the README or other documentation files that list the features of the OWL project. These might be bullet points or detailed descriptions.\\n   - Check for any diagrams, screenshots, or examples that illustrate the features.\\n\\n4. **Explore Use Cases:**\\n   - Search for any mention of use cases in the README or other documentation files. This might include specific scenarios or industries where the OWL project can be applied.\\n   - Look for any case studies or examples provided in the documentation or linked resources.\\n\\n5. **Review Limitations:**\\n   - Look for a section on known issues or limitations. This might be in the README, a separate documentation file, or the \"Issues\" tab.\\n   - Check the \"Issues\" tab for open and closed issues that might highlight limitations or areas for improvement.\\n\\n6. **Examine the Codebase:**\\n   - Browse through the code to understand the structure and implementation. This can provide insights into the project\\'s capabilities and limitations.\\n   - Look for comments or documentation within the code that explain complex parts or highlight limitations.\\n\\n7. **Check the Wiki or Additional Documentation:**\\n   - If the repository has a Wiki or additional documentation, explore these resources for more detailed information about features, use cases, and limitations.\\n\\n8. **Review the Project\\'s Activity:**\\n   - Check the \"Commits\" tab to see the frequency and recency of updates, which can indicate the project\\'s activity level.\\n   - Look at the \"Pull Requests\" tab to see ongoing or recent contributions, which might also highlight new features or fixes.\\n\\n9. **Analyze Community and Support:**\\n   - Review the \"Discussions\" or \"Issues\" tabs to gauge community engagement and support. This can provide insights into common questions or challenges faced by users.\\n\\n10. **Summarize Findings:**\\n    - Compile the information gathered into a detailed analysis, summarizing the features, potential use cases, and current limitations of the OWL project.\\n\\nBy following this plan, you can systematically gather and analyze information about the OWL project on GitHub, while being mindful of the partially observable nature of the task.<detailed_plan>\\n        \\n\\nHere are the current available browser functions you can use:\\n\\n1. `fill_input_id(identifier: Union[str, int], text: str)`: Fill an input\\nfield (e.g. search box) with the given text and press Enter.\\n2. `click_id(identifier: Union[str, int])`: Click an element with the given ID.\\n3. `hover_id(identifier: Union[str, int])`: Hover over an element with the\\ngiven ID.\\n4. `download_file_id(identifier: Union[str, int])`: Download a file with the\\ngiven ID. It returns the path to the downloaded file. If the file is\\nsuccessfully downloaded, you can stop the simulation and report the path to\\nthe downloaded file for further processing.\\n5. `scroll_to_bottom()`: Scroll to the bottom of the page.\\n6. `scroll_to_top()`: Scroll to the top of the page.\\n7. `scroll_up()`: Scroll up the page. It is suitable when you want to see the\\nelements above the current viewport.\\n8. `scroll_down()`: Scroll down the page. It is suitable when you want to see\\nthe elements below the current viewport. If the webpage does not change, It\\nmeans that the webpage has scrolled to the bottom.\\n9. `back()`: Navigate back to the previous page. This is useful when you want\\nto go back to the previous page, as current page is not useful.\\n10. `stop()`: Stop the action process, because the task is completed or failed\\n(impossible to find the answer). In this situation, you should provide your\\nanswer in your output.\\n11. `get_url()`: Get the current URL of the current page.\\n12. `find_text_on_page(search_text: str)`: Find the next given text on the\\ncurrent whole page, and scroll the page to the targeted text. It is equivalent\\nto pressing Ctrl + F and searching for the text, and is powerful when you want\\nto fast-check whether the current page contains some specific text.\\n13. `visit_page(url: str)`: Go to the specific url page.\\n14. `click_blank_area()`: Click a blank area of the page to unfocus the\\ncurrent element. It is useful when you have clicked an element but it cannot\\nunfocus itself (e.g. Menu bar) to automatically render the updated webpage.\\n15. `ask_question_about_video(question: str)`: Ask a question about the\\ncurrent webpage which contains video, e.g. youtube websites.\\n\\n\\nHere are the latest 5 trajectory (at most) you have taken:\\n<history>\\n[{\\'round\\': 2, \\'observation\\': \"The current viewport shows the README.md file of the OWL project on GitHub.

You can check whether the action step is successful by looking at the\\n`success` of the action step in the history. If successful, it means that the\\npage content is indeed the same after the click. You need to try other methods.\\n- If using one way to solve the problem is not successful, try other ways.\\nMake sure your provided ID is correct!\\n- Some cases are very complex and need to be achieve by an iterative process.\\nYou can use the `back()` function to go back to the previous page to try other\\nmethods.\\n- There are many links on the page, which may be useful for solving the\\nproblem. You can use the `click_id()` function to click on the link to see if\\nit is useful.\\n- Always keep in mind that your action must be based on the ID shown in the\\ncurrent image or viewport, not the ID shown in the history.\\n- Do not use `stop()` lightly. Always remind yourself that the image only\\nshows a part of the full page. If you cannot find the answer, try to use\\nfunctions like `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` to check the full content of\\nthe webpage before doing anything else, because the answer or next key step\\nmay be hidden in the content below.\\n- If the webpage needs human verification, you must avoid processing it.\\nPlease use `back()` to go back to the previous page, and try other ways.\\n- If you have tried everything and still cannot resolve the issue, please stop\\nthe simulation, and report issues you have encountered.\\n- Check the history actions carefully, detect whether you have repeatedly made\\nthe same actions or not.\\n- When dealing with wikipedia revision history related tasks, you need to\\nthink about the solution flexibly. First, adjust the browsing history\\ndisplayed on a single page to the maximum, and then make use of the\\nfind_text_on_page function. This is extremely useful which can quickly locate\\nthe text you want to find and skip massive amount of useless information.\\n- Flexibly use interactive elements like slide down selection bar to filter\\nout the information you need. Sometimes they are extremely useful.\\n```\\n        '}, {'type': 'image_url', 'image_url': {'url': 'file:///var/folders/2q/_bzfv_vn0lngh7kmv0q_3rm00000gn/T/image_84e401e2ff.png', 'detail': 'auto'}}]}]\n",
