However, I can provide some guidance on how to find the information you need.\n\nTo find the article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, you can visit the arXiv website and use their search function. Look for articles in the \"Physics and Society\" category and filter by the submission date. Once you locate the article, check the figure with three axes to identify the words used to describe the type of society.\n\nIf you have access to the article or can provide more details, I can help you analyze it further.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: search arXiv for article",
