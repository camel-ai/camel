The DOM snapshot shows the Google Flights landing/search form, not actual search results. It includes key input controls relevant to the task—trip type set to **Round trip**, passenger count button showing **“2”**, cabin class set to **Economy**, origin field showing **Vienna (VIE)**, and destination airport selection showing **MCO (Orlando International Airport)**. However, the **Departure** and **Return** date textboxes are empty (only placeholders), and there are **no flight listings or prices** displayed for July 28–31, 2026. Since the task requires identifying the **cheapest departure and return flights and their total price**, this snapshot lacks the essential evidence (priced itineraries/results) needed to complete the task.\n2. The DOM snapshot is from Google Flights’ main “Flights” page with the search form visible. It shows key search parameters relevant to the task: trip type set to **Round trip**, passenger count button showing **“2”** (implying 2 travelers), cabin class set to **Economy**, and the route fields populated as **Vienna (VIE)** to **Orlando (MCO)**. A date-picker dialog is open, showing calendar months and a note: **“Showing prices in EUR for trips departing on 28 Jul”**, plus a line at the very bottom: **“The cheapest price shown is 1407 euros on Tue, Jul 28.”**\n3. The DOM snapshot is from Google Flights’ main search form with an open date-picker dialog. It shows several task-relevant inputs already set: **Round trip**, **2 passengers** (button showing “2”), **Economy** (cabin class combobox), and the route fields showing **Vienna (VIE)** and **Orlando (MCO)**. The calendar is open and scrolled through months up to **July**, and there is a price hint in the date dialog: “**Showing prices in EUR for trips departing on 28 Jul**” and “**from €1,822 round trip price**.” This is relevant evidence that a July 28 departure is being considered and provides an indicative round-trip “from” price.\n4. The DOM snapshot shows the Google Travel/Flights landing page header and search form state, not actual flight search results. It does include several task-relevant inputs already set: **Round trip**, **2** passengers, **Economy**, origin **Vienna (VIE)**, destination **Orlando (MCO)**. The “Sign in” URL also contains parameters indicating dates **2026-07-28** and **2026-07-31**, which matches the requested range endpoints. However, the main content displayed is promotional/educational content (“Flexible? Discover the best flight deals with AI”, destination cards from Paris, etc.) and footer info—there are **no listed flight options, no prices for VIE↔MCO, and no cheapest departure/return fare breakdown**. Therefore, it does not provide the essential evidence needed to answer “the total price for the cheapest departure and return flight.”\n5. The DOM snapshot is a Google Flights results page for a **round trip** search with the key parameters visible in the search header: **2 passengers**, **Economy**, **Vienna (VIE) → Orlando (MCO)**, and dates implied by the tracking text **“departing 2026-07-28 and returning 2026-07-31”** (also shown as “Jul 28 – 31”).
