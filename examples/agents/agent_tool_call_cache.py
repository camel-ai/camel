"""Real-model example for ChatAgent tool-output caching.

This demo uses a true LLM backend (configured via the default ``ModelFactory``)
and a mock browser snapshot tool. The workflow is:

1. Configure caching in ChatAgent initialization with threshold and cache_dir
2. Ask the agent to capture two snapshots: a long smartphone page and a short
   weather widget
3. Use tool_call_history_cache=True in a step() call to cache tool outputs
   exceeding the threshold
4. Ask the agent a question requiring BOTH cached snapshots - it will use the
   automatically registered ``retrieve_cached_tool_output`` tool to access them
5. Verify the agent can also retrieve a single snapshot when needed

The example demonstrates:
- Automatic caching of large tool outputs (>600 chars)
- Memory efficiency (cached references vs full content)
- Agent's ability to retrieve single or multiple cached outputs
- Seamless access to cached data without manual intervention

Prerequisites:
    - Set up the API credentials required by the default model backend
      (for example, ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` if you're using OpenAI models).
    - Optionally customize ``MODEL_PLATFORM`` / ``MODEL_TYPE`` via
      environment variables to point to a different provider.

>>> Step 3: Ask question requiring BOTH cached snapshots
Assistant response:
Based on the two snapshots I retrieved:

1. **NovaPhone X Ultra battery capacity:** 5,500 mAh

2. **Current temperature:** 68Â°F (partly cloudy)

3. **Creative comparison:**
   Interestingly, the NovaPhone X Ultra's battery capacity (5,500 mAh) is about
   80 times larger than the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (68Â°F)!

   While the phone can power through your day with its massive 5,500 mAh battery
   and 120W wired charging, the weather outside is a pleasant 68Â°F â perfect
   conditions for testing that new phone outdoors without worrying about
   overheating or cold-induced battery drain. The phone's battery is built for
   performance in any weather!

>>> Step 4: Verify agent can access single snapshot
Assistant response:
According to the weather widget snapshot, the sunset time is **7:42 PM**.
