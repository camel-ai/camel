Agent Summarization Examples

This module contains two demonstrations:

1. Food Preference Memory Example:
   Agent1 learns user's food preferences and creates a summary.
   Agent2 retrieves Agent1's memory and continues similar tasks.

2. Terminal Toolkit & Summarization Example:
   Agent performs terminal operations using CAMEL's terminal toolkit,
   then summarizes its terminal session and displays the summary.

# Agent Conversation Summary

    Conversation Summary

1) Conversation Overview
- Main topics:
  - Basic system inspection (current directory, directory listing).
  - File creation and simple file management inside a working directory.
  - Searching files for text patterns and generating a report of matches.
  - Organizing results and creating a final summary of operations.
- Key themes:
  - Reproducible shell-based operations.
  - Simple text processing (grep) and file reporting.
  - Ensuring a clear audit of created/modified files and disk usage.

2) Important Decisions / Conclusions
- Work was performed in: /Users/jinx0a/Repo/camel/terminal_demo
- Created a working subdirectory test_data (or used existing) to hold sample 
files and reports.
- Patterns selected for text search: TODO, ERROR, IMPORTANT.
- A scan summary was written into test_data/scan_summary.txt and a final 
summary into final_operations_summary.txt.
- Noted issue: the scan_summary.txt was created inside test_data and then 
included in the grep scan, causing the summary to include its own output and
inflate pattern totals. Corrected totals (excluding the summary file) were
computed and reported.

3) Action Items ‚Äî Tasks Completed (with key outputs)
- Inspected current directory:
  - pwd -> /Users/jinx0a/Repo/camel/terminal_demo
  - ls -la -> listed files and directories in the working directory.
