# Answer to example question 2
"""
$Final Report$

根据你的搞笑问题：“巩汉林喝了一杯太后大酒楼的宫廷玉液酒，又请黄大锤用大锤掏壁橱，一共花多少钱？”我们进行如下分析与计算：

1. **宫廷玉液酒的价格**：
   根据我们的调查，“宫廷玉液酒”（也称鹤年台宫廷玉液酒）的市场价格为180元。这个价格不仅代表了其商业价值，也承载了丰富的文化内涵，其在1996年的央视春晚小品中被提到过，进一步增强了其知名度。

2. **黄大锤掏壁橱的费用**：
   在小品《装修》中，角色黄大锤的收费标准被广泛传播，小锤的费用为40元，而大锤的费用为80元。因此，黄大锤用大锤掏壁橱的费用是80元。

3. **计算总费用**：
   将巩汉林喝酒的费用（180元）与黄大锤掏壁橱的费用（80元）相加：
   \[
   \text{总费用} = 180 \text{元} + 80 \text{元} = 260 \text{元}
   \]

综上所述，巩汉林喝了一杯宫廷玉液酒，并请黄大锤用大锤掏壁橱，总共花费为260元。
