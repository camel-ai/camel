For simplicity, consider a one-dimensional problem only. Let two frames $F$ and $F^{\\prime}$ be such that the frame $F^{\\prime}$ moves at relative velocity $v$ in the positive- $x$ direction compared to frame $F$. Denote the coordinates of $F$ as $(x, t)$ and the coordinates of $F^{\\prime}$ as $\\left(x^{\\prime}, t^{\\prime}\\right)$.\n\nThe most general coordinate transformations between $F$ and $F^{\\prime}$ are given by functions $X, T$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{\\prime} & =X(x, t, v) \\\\\nt^{\\prime} & =T(x, t, v)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich we will refer to as the generalized boost.\nContext question:\n(a) The homogeneity of space and time imply that the laws of physics are the same no matter where in space and time you are. In other words, they do not depend on a choice of origin for coordinates $x$ and $t$. Use this fact to show that $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}$ is independent of the position $x$ and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ is independent of the time $t$. (Hint: Recall the definition of the partial derivative.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nAnalogously, we can conclude additionally that $\\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial x}$ is independent of both $x$ and $t$ and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ is independent of $x$ and $t$. It can be shown that $X, T$ may be given in the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX(x, t, v) & =A(v) x+B(v) t \\\\\nT(x, t, v) & =C(v) x+D(v) t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A, B, C, D$ are functions of $v$. In other words, the generalized boost is a linear transformation of coordinates.\nContext question:\n(b) The isotropy of space implies that there is no preferred direction in the universe, i.e., that the laws of physics are the same in all directions. Use this to study the general coordinate transformations $X, T$ after setting $x \\rightarrow-x$ and $x^{\\prime} \\rightarrow-x^{\\prime}$ and conclude that $A(v), D(v)$ are even functions of $v$ and $B(v), C(v)$ are odd functions of $v$. (Hint: the relative velocity $v$ is a number which is measured by the $F$ frame using $v=\\frac{d x}{d t}$.)\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nContext question:\n(c) The principle of relativity implies that the laws of physics are agreed upon by observers in inertial frames. This implies that the general coordinate transformations $X, T$ are invertible and their inverses have the same functional form as $X, T$ after setting $v \\rightarrow-v$. Use this fact to show the following system of equations hold:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA(v)^{2}-B(v) C(v) & =1 \\\\\nD(v)^{2}-B(v) C(v) & =1 \\\\\nC(v)(A(v)-D(v)) & =0 \\\\\nB(v)(A(v)-D(v)) & =0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(Hint: It's convenient to write $X, T$ as matrices and recall the definition of matrix inverses.) Physically, we must have that $B(v)$ and $C(v)$ are not both identically zero for nonzero $v$. So, we can conclude from the above that $D(v)=A(v)$ and $C(v)=\\frac{A(v)^{2}-1}{B(v)}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nContext question:\n(d) Use the previous results and the fact that the location of the $F^{\\prime}$ frame may be given by $x=v t$ in the $F$ frame to conclude that the coordinate transformations have the following form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{\\prime} & =A(v) x-v A(v) t \\\\\nt^{\\prime} & =-\\left(\\frac{A(v)^{2}-1}{v A(v)}\\right) x+A(v) t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nContext question:\n(e) Assume that a composition of boosts results in a boost of the same functional form. Use this fact and all the previous results you have derived about these generalized boosts to conclude that\n\n$$\n\\frac{A(v)^{2}-1}{v^{2} A(v)}=\\kappa .\n$$\n\nfor an arbitrary constant $\\kappa$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nContext question:\n(f) (1 point) Show that $\\kappa$ has dimensions of (velocity $)^{-2}$, and show that the generalized boost now has the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^{\\prime} & =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\kappa v^{2}}}(x-v t) \\\\\nt^{\\prime} & =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\kappa v^{2}}}(t-\\kappa v x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n\n\nContext question:\n(g) Assume that $v$ may be infinite. Argue that $\\kappa=0$ and show that you recover the Galilean boost. Under this assumption, explain using a Galilean boost why this implies that a particle may travel arbitrarily fast.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{证明题}\n",

Then, the oscillating field is turned on, where its frequency $\\omega$ is chosen to be in resonance with the Larmor precession frequency $\\omega_{0}$, i.e. $\\omega=\\omega_{0}$. In other words, the total field after time $t=0$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}(t)=B_{0} \\boldsymbol{k}+2 b \\cos \\omega_{0} t \\boldsymbol{i} .\n$$\nContext question:\n1.  In the rotating frame $S^{\\prime}$, show that the effective field can be approximated by\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B}_{\\text {eff }} \\approx b \\boldsymbol{i}^{\\prime},\n$$\n\nwhich is commonly known as rotating wave approximation. What is the precession frequency $\\Omega$ in frame $S^{\\prime}$ ?\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\Omega=\\gamma b$}\n",
