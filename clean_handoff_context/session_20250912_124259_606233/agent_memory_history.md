Hi Sarah! Making fresh pasta is a delightful process. You can use either all-purpose flour or semolina flour, or even a mix of the two for a different texture. Here’s a simple recipe for fresh pasta using semolina and all-purpose flour:

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups semolina flour (or a mix of 1 cup semolina and 1 cup all-purpose flour)
- 2 large eggs
- A pinch of salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)
- Water (as needed)

### Instructions:

1. **Make the Dough:**
   - If using a mixing bowl, combine the semolina flour, pinch of salt, and olive oil (if using). Make a well in the center and crack the eggs into the well.
   - Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs, starting from the inner rim of the well, until a shaggy dough forms.
   - If the dough feels too dry, add a little water (1 tablespoon at a time). If it's too wet, sprinkle in a bit more flour.

2. **Knead:**
   - Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough sticks, lightly dust with flour.

3. **Rest the Dough:**
   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the gluten to relax.

4. **Roll Out the Dough:**
   - After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions for easier rolling. Flatten one piece slightly and keep the others covered.
   - Use a rolling pin or a pasta machine to roll the dough out to your desired thickness (usually about 1/8 inch thick for fettuccine or thinner for lasagna).

5. **Cut the Pasta:**
   - Cut the rolled-out dough into your desired shape: tagliatelle, fettuccine, or even lasagna sheets. Dust the cut pasta with a little flour to prevent sticking.

6. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for about 2-4 minutes (fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried pasta).
   - Taste a piece to see if it’s done to your liking!

7. **Serve:**
   - Drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce. Enjoy!
