<p style="line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;"> üê´ CAMEL is an open-source community dedicated to finding the scaling laws of agents. We believe that studying these agents on a large scale offers valuable insights into their behaviors, capabilities, and potential risks. To facilitate research in this field, we implement and support various types of agents, tasks, prompts, models, and simulated environments.</p>

## CAMEL Framework Design Principles

<h3>üß¨¬†Evolvability</h3 >

The framework enables multi-agent systems to continuously evolve by generating data and interacting with environments. This evolution can be driven by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards or supervised learning.

<h3>üìà¬†Scalability</h3>

The framework is designed to support systems with millions of agents, ensuring efficient coordination, communication, and resource management at scale.

<h3>üíæ¬†Statefulness</h3>

Agents maintain stateful memory, enabling them to perform multi-step interactions with environments and efficiently tackle sophisticated tasks.

<h3>üìñ¬†Code-as-Prompt</h3>

Every line of code and comment serves as a prompt for agents. Code should be written clearly and readably, ensuring both humans and agents can interpret it effectively.

## Quick Start

Installing CAMEL is a breeze thanks to its availability on PyPI. Simply open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install camel-ai
```

### Starting with ChatAgent

This example demonstrates how to create a `ChatAgent` using the CAMEL framework and perform a search query using DuckDuckGo.

1. **Install the tools package:**

  ```bash
  pip install 'camel-ai[web_tools]'
  ```

2. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
  ```

3. **Run the following Python code:**

  ```python
  from camel.models import ModelFactory
  from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
  from camel.agents import ChatAgent
  from camel.toolkits import SearchToolkit

  model = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
    model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O,
    model_config_dict={"temperature": 0.0},
  )

  search_tool = SearchToolkit().search_duckduckgo

  agent = ChatAgent(model=model, tools=[search_tool])

  response_1 = agent.step("What is CAMEL-AI?")
  print(response_1.msgs[0].content)
  # CAMEL-AI is the first LLM (Large Language Model) multi-agent framework
  # and an open-source community focused on finding the scaling laws of agents.
  # ...

  response_2 = agent.step("What is the Github link to CAMEL framework?")
  print(response_2.msgs[0].content)
  # The GitHub link to the CAMEL framework is
  # [https://github.com/camel-ai/camel](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel).
  ```

## Acknowledgment
Special thanks to [Nomic AI](https://home.nomic.ai/) for giving us extended access to their data set exploration tool (Atlas).

We would also like to thank Haya Hammoud for designing the initial logo of our project.

We implemented amazing research ideas from other works for you to build, compare and customize your agents. If you use any of these modules, please kindly cite the original works:
- `TaskCreationAgent`, `TaskPrioritizationAgent` and `BabyAGI` from *Nakajima et al.*: [Task-Driven Autonomous Agent](https://yoheinakajima.com/task-driven-autonomous-agent-utilizing-gpt-4-pinecone-and-langchain-for-diverse-applications/). [[Example](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/examples/ai_society/babyagi_playing.py)]

- `PersonaHub` from *Tao Ge et al.*: [Scaling Synthetic Data Creation with 1,000,000,000 Personas](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.20094). [[Example](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/examples/personas/personas_generation.py)]

- `Self-Instruct` from *Yizhong Wang et al.*: [SELF-INSTRUCT: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10560). [[Example](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/examples/datagen/self_instruct/self_instruct.py)]
