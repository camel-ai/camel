class ZhipuAIConfig(BaseConfig):
    r"""Defines the parameters for generating chat completions using OpenAI
    compatibility

    Reference: https://open.bigmodel.cn/dev/api#glm-4v

    Args:
        temperature (float, optional): Sampling temperature to use, between
            :obj:`0` and :obj:`2`. Higher values make the output more random,
            while lower values make it more focused and deterministic.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        top_p (float, optional): An alternative to sampling with temperature,
            called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of
            the tokens with top_p probability mass. So :obj:`0.1` means only
            the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        stream (bool, optional): If True, partial message deltas will be sent
            as data-only server-sent events as they become available.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        stop (str or list, optional): Up to :obj:`4` sequences where the API
            will stop generating further tokens. (default: :obj:`None`)
        max_tokens (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens to generate
            in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and
            generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
            (default: :obj:`None`)
        tools (list[FunctionTool], optional): A list of tools the model may
            call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this
            to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
            for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
        tool_choice (Union[dict[str, str], str], optional): Controls which (if
            any) tool is called by the model. :obj:`"none"` means the model
            will not call any tool and instead generates a message.
            :obj:`"auto"` means the model can pick between generating a
            message or calling one or more tools.  :obj:`"required"` means the
            model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool
            via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}
            forces the model to call that tool. :obj:`"none"` is the default
            when no tools are present. :obj:`"auto"` is the default if tools
            are present.
