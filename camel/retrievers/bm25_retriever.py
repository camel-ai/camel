class BM25Retriever(BaseRetriever):
    r"""An implementation of the `BaseRetriever` using the `BM25` model.

    This class facilitates the retriever of relevant information using a
    query-based approach, it ranks documents based on the occurrence and
    frequency of the query terms.

    Attributes:
        bm25 (BM25Okapi): An instance of the BM25Okapi class used for
            calculating document scores.
        content_input_path (str): The path to the content that has been
            processed and stored.
        unstructured_modules (UnstructuredIO): A module for parsing files and
            URLs and chunking content based on specified parameters.
