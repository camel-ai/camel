TASK_DECOMPOSE_PROMPT = r"""You need to either decompose a complex task or enhance a simple one, following these important principles to maximize efficiency and clarity for the executing agents:

0.  **Analyze Task Complexity**: First, evaluate if the task is a single, straightforward action or a complex one.
    *   **If the task is complex or could be decomposed into multiple subtasks run in parallel, decompose it.** A task is considered complex if it involves multiple distinct steps, requires different skills, or can be significantly sped up by running parts in parallel.
    *   **If the task is simple, do not decompose it.** Instead, **rewrite and enhance** it to produce a high-quality task with a clear, specific deliverable.

1.  **Self-Contained Subtasks** (if decomposing): This is critical principle. Each subtask's description **must be fully self-sufficient and independently understandable**. The agent executing the subtask has **no knowledge** of the parent task, other subtasks, or the overall workflow.
    *   **DO NOT** use relative references like "the first task," "the paper mentioned above," or "the result from the previous step."
    *   **DO** write explicit instructions. For example, instead of "Analyze the document," write "Analyze the document titled 'The Future of AI'." The system will automatically provide the necessary inputs (like the document itself) from previous steps.

2.  **Define Clear Deliverables** (for all tasks and subtasks): Each task or subtask must specify a clear, concrete deliverable. This tells the agent exactly what to produce and provides a clear "definition of done."
    *   **DO NOT** use vague verbs like "analyze," "look into," or "research" without defining the output.
    *   **DO** specify the format and content of the output. For example, instead of "Analyze the attached report," write "Summarize the key findings of the attached report in a 3-bullet-point list." Instead of "Find contacts," write "Extract all names and email addresses from the document and return them as a JSON list of objects, where each object has a 'name' and 'email' key."

3.  **Full Workflow Completion & Strategic Grouping** (if decomposing):
    *   **Preserve the Entire Goal**: Ensure the decomposed subtasks collectively achieve the *entire* original task. Do not drop or ignore final steps like sending a message, submitting a form, or creating a file.
    *   **Group Sequential Actions**: If a series of steps must be done in order *and* can be handled by the same worker type (e.g., read, think, reply), group them into a single, comprehensive subtask. This maintains workflow and ensures the final goal is met.

4.  **Aggressive Parallelization** (if decomposing):
    *   **Across Different Worker Specializations**: If distinct phases of the overall task require different types of workers (e.g., research by a 'SearchAgent', then content creation by a 'DocumentAgent'), define these as separate subtasks.
    *   **Within a Single Phase (Data/Task Parallelism)**: If a phase involves repetitive operations on multiple items (e.g., processing 10 documents, fetching 5 web pages, analyzing 3 datasets):
        *   Decompose this into parallel subtasks, one for each item or a small batch of items.
        *   This applies even if the same type of worker handles these parallel subtasks. The goal is to leverage multiple available workers or allow concurrent processing.

5.  **Subtask Design for Efficiency** (if decomposing):
    *   **Actionable and Well-Defined**: Each subtask should have a clear, achievable goal.
    *   **Balanced Granularity**: Make subtasks large enough to be meaningful but small enough to enable parallelism and quick feedback. Avoid overly large subtasks that hide parallel opportunities.
    *   **Consider Dependencies**: While you list tasks sequentially, think about the true dependencies. The workforce manager will handle execution based on these implied dependencies and worker availability.

These principles aim to reduce overall completion time by maximizing concurrent work and effectively utilizing all available worker capabilities.

**EXAMPLE FORMAT ONLY** (DO NOT use this example content for actual task decomposition):

***
**Example 1: Sequential Task for a Single Worker**

*   **Overall Task**: "Create a short blog post about the benefits of Python. First, research the key benefits. Then, write a 300-word article. Finally, find a suitable image to go with it."
*   **Available Workers**:
    *   `Document Agent`: A worker that can research topics, write articles, and find images.
*   **Correct Decomposition**:
    ```xml
    <tasks>
    <task>Create a short blog post about the benefits of Python by researching key benefits, writing a 300-word article, and finding a suitable image. The final output should be a single string containing the 300-word article followed by the image URL.</task>
    </tasks>
    ```
*   **Reasoning**: All steps are sequential and can be handled by the same worker type (`Document Agent`). Grouping them into one subtask is efficient and maintains the workflow, following the "Strategic Grouping" principle. **The deliverable is clearly defined as a single string.**

***
**Example 2: Parallel Task Across Different Workers**

*   **Overall Task**: "Write a report on the Q2 performance of Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL). The report needs a financial summary and a market sentiment analysis for each company."
*   **Available Workers**:
    *   `financial_analyst_1`: A worker that can analyze financial data and create summaries.
    *   `market_researcher_1`: A worker that can perform market sentiment analysis.
    *   `report_writer_1`: A worker that compiles information into a final report.
*   **Correct Decomposition**:
    ```xml
    <tasks>
    <task>Create a 1-paragraph financial summary for Apple (AAPL) for Q2, covering revenue, net income, and EPS. The output must be a plain text paragraph.</task>
    <task>Create a 1-paragraph financial summary for Google (GOOGL) for Q2, covering revenue, net income, and EPS. The output must be a plain text paragraph.</task>
    <task>Perform a market sentiment analysis for Apple (AAPL) for Q2, returning a single sentiment score from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). The output must be a single floating-point number.</task>
    <task>Perform a market sentiment analysis for Google (GOOGL) for Q2, returning a single sentiment score from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). The output must be a single floating-point number.</task>
    <task>Compile the provided financial summaries and market sentiment scores for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) into a single Q2 performance report. The report should be a markdown-formatted document.</task>
    </tasks>
    ```
*   **Reasoning**: The financial analysis and market research can be done in parallel for both companies. The final report depends on all previous steps. This decomposition leverages worker specialization and parallelism, following the "Aggressive Parallelization" principle. **Each subtask has a clearly defined deliverable.**
***

**END OF EXAMPLES** - Now, apply these principles and examples to decompose the following task.

Following are the available workers, given in the format <ID>: <description>:<toolkit_info>.

==============================
{child_nodes_info}
==============================

You must return the subtasks as a list of individual subtasks within <tasks> tags. If your decomposition, following the principles and detailed example above (e.g., for summarizing multiple papers), results in several parallelizable actions, EACH of those actions must be represented as a separate <task> entry. For instance, the general format is:

<tasks>
<task>Subtask 1</task>
<task>Subtask 2</task>
</tasks>

Each subtask should be:
- **Self-contained and independently understandable.**
- Clear and concise.
- Achievable by a single worker.
- Containing all sequential steps that should be performed by the same worker type.
- Written without any relative references (e.g., "the previous task").

TASK_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = TextPrompt(
    """You are analyzing a task to evaluate its quality and determine recovery actions if needed.

**TASK INFORMATION:**
- Task ID: {task_id}
- Task Content: {task_content}
- Task Result: {task_result}
- Failure Count: {failure_count}
- Task Depth: {task_depth}
- Assigned Worker: {assigned_worker}

**ISSUE TYPE: {issue_type}**

{issue_specific_analysis}

**STEP 1: EVALUATE TASK QUALITY**

First, assess whether the task was completed successfully and meets quality standards:

**For Task Failures (with error messages):**
- The task did not complete successfully
- An error occurred during execution
- Quality is automatically insufficient
- Focus on analyzing the error cause

**For Quality Issues (task completed but needs evaluation):**
Evaluate the task result based on these criteria:
1. **Completeness**: Does the result fully address all task requirements?
2. **Accuracy**: Is the result correct and well-structured?
3. **Missing Elements**: Are there any missing components or quality issues?

Provide:
- Quality score (0-100): Objective assessment of result quality
- Specific issues list: Any problems found in the result
- Quality sufficient: Boolean indicating if quality meets standards

**STEP 2: DETERMINE RECOVERY STRATEGY (if quality insufficient)**

If the task quality is insufficient, select the best recovery strategy:

**Available Strategies:**

1. **retry** - Retry with the same worker and task content
   - **Best for**:
     * Network errors, connection timeouts, temporary API issues
     * Random failures that are likely temporary
     * Minor quality issues that may resolve on retry
   - **Not suitable for**:
     * Fundamental task misunderstandings
     * Worker capability gaps
     * Persistent quality problems

2. **reassign** - Assign to a different worker
   - **Best for**:
     * Current worker lacks required skills/expertise
     * Worker-specific quality issues
     * Task requires different specialization
   - **Not suitable for**:
     * Task description is unclear (use replan instead)
     * Task is too complex (use decompose instead)
   - **Note**: Only available for quality issues, not failures

3. **replan** - Modify task content with clearer instructions
   - **Best for**:
     * Unclear or ambiguous requirements
     * Missing context or information
     * Task description needs improvement
   - **Requirements**:
     * Provide modified_task_content with enhanced, clear instructions
     * Modified task must be actionable for an AI agent
     * Address the root cause identified in issues

4. **decompose** - Break into smaller, manageable subtasks
   - **Best for**:
     * Task is too complex for a single worker
     * Multiple distinct sub-problems exist
     * Persistent failures despite retries
     * Capability mismatches that need specialization
   - **Consider**:
     * Task depth (avoid if depth > 2)
     * Whether subtasks can run in parallel

5. **create_worker** - Create new specialized worker
   - **Best for**:
     * No existing worker has required capabilities
     * Need specialized skills not currently available
   - **Consider**:
     * Whether decomposition could work instead
     * Cost of creating new worker vs alternatives
   - **Note**: Only available for task failures, not quality issues

**DECISION GUIDELINES:**

**Priority Rules:**
1. Connection/Network Errors → **retry** (almost always)
2. Deep Tasks (depth > 2) → Avoid decompose, prefer **retry** or **replan**
3. Worker Skill Mismatch → **reassign** (quality) or **decompose** (failure)
4. Unclear Requirements → **replan** with specifics
5. Task Too Complex → **decompose** into subtasks

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**

- Return ONLY a valid JSON object
- No explanations or text outside the JSON structure
- Ensure all required fields are included
- Use null for optional fields when not applicable
