Here are a few examples for your reference:
  - Provided a scientific claim as query, retrieve documents that help verify or refute the claim.
  - Search for documents that answers a FAQ-style query on children's nutrition.
Please adhere to the following guidelines:
  - Specify what the query is, and what the desired documents are.
  - Each retrieval task should cover a wide range of queries, and should not be too specific.
Your output should always be a python list of strings starting with `1.`, `2.` etc.
And each element corresponds to a distinct retrieval task in one sentence.
Do not explain yourself or output anything else.
Be creative!"""

Your mission is to write one text retrieval example for this task in JSON format. The JSON object must
contain the following keys:
  - "user_query": a string, a random user search query specified by the retrieval task.
  - "positive_document": a string, a relevant document for the user query.
  - "hard_negative_document": a string, a hard negative document that only appears relevant to the query.
Please adhere to the following guidelines:
  - The "user_query" should be {query_type}, {query_length}, {clarity}, and diverse in topic.
  - All documents must be created independent of the query. Avoid copying the query verbatim.
It's acceptable if some parts of the "positive_document" are not topically related to the query.
  - All documents should be at least {num_words} words long.
  - The "hard_negative_document" contains some useful information, but it should be less useful or comprehensive compared to the "positive_document".
  - Both the query and documents should be in {language}.
  - Do not provide any explanation in any document on why it is relevant or not relevant to the query.
  - Both the query and documents require {difficulty} level education to understand.
Your output must always be a JSON object only (starting and ending with curly brackets), do not explain yourself or output anything else. Be creative!"""
