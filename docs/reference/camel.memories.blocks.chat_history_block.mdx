## ChatHistoryBlock Objects

```python
class ChatHistoryBlock(MemoryBlock)
```

An implementation of the :obj:`MemoryBlock` abstract base class for
maintaining a record of chat histories.

This memory block helps manage conversation histories with a key-value
storage backend, either provided by the user or using a default
in-memory storage. It offers a windowed approach to retrieving chat
histories, allowing users to specify how many recent messages they'd
like to fetch.

**Arguments**:

- `storage` _BaseKeyValueStorage, optional_ - A storage mechanism for
  storing chat history. If `None`, an :obj:`InMemoryKeyValueStorage`
  will be used. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `keep_rate` _float, optional_ - In historical messages, the score of the
  last message is 1.0, and with each step taken backward, the score
  of the message is multiplied by the `keep_rate`. Higher `keep_rate`
  leads to high possibility to keep history messages during context
  creation.

#### retrieve

```python
def retrieve(window_size: Optional[int] = None) -> List[ContextRecord]
```

Retrieves records with a proper size for the agent from the memory
based on the window size or fetches the entire chat history if no
window size is specified.

**Arguments**:

- `window_size` _int, optional_ - Specifies the number of recent chat
  messages to retrieve. If not provided, the entire chat history
  will be retrieved. (default: :obj:`None`)
  

**Returns**:

- `List[ContextRecord]` - A list of retrieved records.

<a id="camel.memories.blocks.chat_history_block.ChatHistoryBlock.write_records"></a>

#### write\_records

```python
def write_records(records: List[MemoryRecord]) -> None
```

Writes memory records to the memory. Additionally, performs
validation checks on the messages.

**Arguments**:

- `records` _List[MemoryRecord]_ - Memory records to be added to the
  memory.

<a id="camel.memories.blocks.chat_history_block.ChatHistoryBlock.clear"></a>

#### clear

```python
def clear() -> None
```

Clears all chat messages from the memory.
