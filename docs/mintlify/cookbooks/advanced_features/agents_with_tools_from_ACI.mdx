[ACI.dev](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci) is the open source platform that connects your AI agents to 600+ tool integrations. Integrate [ACI.dev](https://www.aci.dev/docs/introduction/overview) with CAMEL agents to let them seamlessly interact with these external apps.

*Goal: Star a repository on GitHub with natural language & CAMEL Agent*

### Install Packages & Connect a Tool

Integrate ACI with CAMEL agents to let them seamlessly interact with external apps.

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed and connect your GitHub account to allow your CAMEL-AI agents to utilize GitHub functionalities on [*ACI.dev*](https://platform.aci.dev/apps).


```python
# Run command
%pip install "camel-ai[all]==0.2.59"
```

### Prepare your environment by initializing necessary imports from CAMEL.


```python
from camel.agents import ChatAgent
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.toolkits import ACIToolkit
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
```

### Provide the API key and the LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER from [*ACI.dev*](https://platform.aci.dev/apps) to the SDK.


```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Prompt for the API key securely
openai_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = openai_api_key
# Prompt for the ACI key securely
aci_api_key = getpass('Enter your ACI API key: ')
os.environ["ACI_API_KEY"] = aci_api_key
# Prompt for your linked account owner id securely
linked_account_owner_id = getpass('Enter your linked account owner id: ')
os.environ["LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER"] = linked_account_owner_id
```

### Let‚Äôs run CAMEL agents with tools from ACI!


```python
# Get the value of the environment variable "LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER"
LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER = os.getenv("LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER")

# Check if the environment variable was set
if LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER is None:
    raise ValueError("LINKED_ACCOUNT_owner environment variable is not set.")
```


```python
# Initialize ACI Toolkit with GitHub integration
aci_toolkit = ACIToolkit(linked_account_owner_id=LINKED_ACCOUNT_OWNER)

# Create default model instance
model = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.DEFAULT,
    model_type=ModelType.DEFAULT,
)

# Set up chat agent with GitHub tools
chat_agent = ChatAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=aci_toolkit.get_tools(),  # GitHub tools enabled
)
```


```python
# Execute GitHub star command
response = chat_agent.step("star the repo camel-ai/camel")
print(response)
```
