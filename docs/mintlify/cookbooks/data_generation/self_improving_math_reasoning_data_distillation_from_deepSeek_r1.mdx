This notebook introduces CAMEL's powerful self-improving data distillation pipeline, specifically designed to generate high-quality reasoning datasets. By incorporating self-improvement through iterative refinement, CAMEL enables the creation of long chain-of-thought (CoT) data with detailed reasoning processes.

What Makes This Approach Special?

- Self-Improvement: The key feature of this pipeline is the ability to iteratively improve reasoning traces. By setting evaluation agent and a maximum number of iterations (e.g., max_iterations=2), the reasoning process is enhanced step by step, improve the quality of the solutions.

- Reasoning Trace Generation: CAMEL generates detailed reasoning for each mathematical problem. The generated traces are continuously evaluated, and based on feedback, they are refined and improved.

Through CAMEL‚Äôs self-improvement mechanism, we ensure that the generated reasoning data continuously evolves, producing high-quality synthetic data that enhance problem-solving skills.

Through the use of our synthetic data generation pipeline, CAEML-AI has crafted three comprehensive datasets that are now available to enhance your mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills. These datasets are hosted on Hugging Face for easy access:

- **üìö AMC AIME STaR Dataset**

  A dataset of 4K advanced mathematical problems and solutions, distilled with improvement history showing how the solution was iteratively refined.
  üîó [Explore the Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/camel-ai/amc_aime_star)  

- **üìö AMC AIME Distilled Dataset**

  A dataset of 4K advanced mathematical problems and solutions, distilled with clear step-by-step solutions. üîó [Explore the Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/camel-ai/amc_aime_distilled)  

- **üìö GSM8K Distilled Dataset**

  A dataset of 7K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems and solutions, distilled with clear step-by-step solutions. üîó [Explore the Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/camel-ai/gsm8k_distilled)   


Perfect for those eager to explore AI-driven problem-solving or dive deep into mathematical reasoning! üöÄ‚ú®

## üì¶ Installation

Firstly, we need to install the camel-ai package for datagen pipeline


```python
%%capture
!pip install "git+https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.git@f028e39fb2fbedcd30f43036899d3d13e5c25b01#egg=camel-ai"
!pip install datasets
!pip install rouge
```

## üîë Setting Up API Keys

Let's set the `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` that will be used to distill the maths reasoning data with thought process.

‚≠ê **NOTE**: You could also use other model provider like Together AI, SilionFlow


```python
from getpass import getpass
import os
```


```python
FIREWORKS_API_KEY = getpass('Enter your FIREWORKS_API_KEY: ')
os.environ["FIREWORKS_API_KEY"] = FIREWORKS_API_KEY
```


```python
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = getpass('Enter your DEEPSEEK_API_KEY: ')
os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"] = DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

Alternatively, if running on Colab, you could save your API keys and tokens as **Colab Secrets**, and use them across notebooks.

To do so, **comment out** the above **manual** API key prompt code block(s), and **uncomment** the following codeblock.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget granting access to the API key you would be using to the current notebook.


```python
# import os
# from google.colab import userdata

# os.environ["FIREWORKS_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("FIREWORKS_API_KEY")
# os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY")
```


```python
#to make deepseek r1 responds with thought process content,we should set the following environment variable
os.environ["GET_REASONING_CONTENT"]="True"
```

## üì• Download Dataset from Hugging Face and Convert to the Desired Format


Now, lets start to prepare the original maths  data from Hugging Face ,which mainly have two important key: questions and answers. We will use GSM8K as example.


```python
# Set the number of problems to download from GSM8K in huggingface
NUMBER_OF_PROBLEMS=5
```

After we download these datasets, we will convert these datasets to the desired format which suitable to be used in **CAMEL's data distillation pipeline**.


```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
import uuid
from datasets import load_dataset

def download_gsm8k_dataset():
    try:
        # Load the dataset using the datasets library
        dataset = load_dataset("openai/gsm8k", "main")

        # Get the first 5 items from train split
        data = dataset['train'].select(range(NUMBER_OF_PROBLEMS))

        # Convert to the desired format
        formatted_data = []
        for item in data:
            # Extract the final answer from the solution
            solution = item['answer']
            if solution:
                # GSM8K solutions typically end with "#### number"
                import re

                match = re.search(r'####\s*(\d+)', solution)
                if match:
                    number = match.group(1)
                    # Replace the "#### number" with "\boxed{number}"
                    solution = re.sub(
                        r'####\s*\d+', f'\\\\boxed{{{number}}}', solution
                    )

            formatted_item = {
                "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),  # GSM8K doesn't provide IDs
                "problem": item['question'],
                "type": "openai/gsm8k",  # All problems are from GSM8K
                "solution": solution,  # Use the modified solution with \boxed
            }
            formatted_data.append(formatted_item)

        # Save to a file
        output = formatted_data
        output_file = "downloaded_gsm8k_10.json"
        with open(output_file, "w") as f:
            json.dump(output, f, indent=2)

        print(f"Successfully downloaded and saved GSM8K dataset to {output_file}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading GSM8K dataset: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    download_gsm8k_dataset()
```

Cool! Now you have already got some desired format example data,lets move to start to distill some maths reasoning data with thought process.

## üöÄ Begin Distilling Mathematical Reasoning Data with Thought Process (Long CoT Data).

The Self-Improving CoT Pipeline is at the heart of CAMEL‚Äôs self-improving mechanism. It generates reasoning traces, evaluates them, and refines them iteratively. The pipeline executes the following core steps:

- Initial Reasoning Generation: For each problem, an initial reasoning trace is created by the agent.

- Self-Evaluation: The agent evaluates the trace for correctness, clarity, and completeness. We also support evaluation with reward model

- Iterative Improvement: Based on the evaluation feedback, the reasoning trace is iteratively improved, ensuring enhanced logic and clarity with each iteration.

Final Refinement: The pipeline repeats the feedback loop up to max_iterations=2 times (you can adjust this number), continuously refining the reasoning until it meets the desired quality.

Import required libraries:


```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

import json
import os
import time

from camel.agents import ChatAgent
from camel.datagen import SelfImprovingCoTPipeline
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
```

Next, let's set up the reasoning model and evaluate model. Since the DeepSeek's API service is currently unstable, we will also set DeepSeek R1 served by [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/). CAMEL's model manager to automatically switch models based on the success of the request.


```python
# Set llama3.3 70b as evaluate model
evaluate_model = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL,
    model_type="accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p3-70b-instruct",
    api_key=os.environ["FIREWORKS_API_KEY"],
    url="https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1",
)


# Set DeepSeek R1 served by Fireworks as reason model 1
reason_model_1 = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL,
    model_type="accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-r1",
    api_key=os.environ["FIREWORKS_API_KEY"],
    url="https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1",
    model_config_dict={"max_tokens": 2000}, # Config the max_token carefully
)

# Set DeepSeek R1 served by deepseek cloud as reason model 2
reason_model_2 = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.DEEPSEEK,
    model_type=ModelType.DEEPSEEK_REASONER,
)
```

Now we can start to execute CAMEL's SelfImprovingCoTPipeline.


```python
start_time = time.time()
problems_path = "downloaded_gsm8k_10.json"
output_path = "generated_data.json"

# Load problems from JSON file
with open(problems_path, 'r') as f:
    problems = json.load(f)

# Initialize agent
reason_agent_system_message = """Answer my question and give your
final answer within \\boxed{}."""
evaluate_agent_system_message = """You are a highly critical teacher who
evaluates the student's answers with a meticulous and demanding approach.
"""

# Set up reason agent
reason_agent = ChatAgent(
    system_message=reason_agent_system_message,
    model=[reason_model_1, reason_model_2], # add models to the list
)

# Set up evaluate agent
evaluate_agent = ChatAgent(
    system_message=evaluate_agent_system_message,
    model=evaluate_model,
)

# # Initialize reward model (optional)
# reward_model = NemotronRewardModel(
#     model_type=ModelType.NVIDIA_NEMOTRON_340B_REWARD,
#     url="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",
#     api_key=os.environ.get("NVIDIA_API_KEY"),
# )

# Set score thresholds for different dimensions (optional)
score_threshold = {
    "correctness": 1.0,
    "clarity": 0.0,
    "completeness": 0.0,
}
# # Or use a single threshold for all dimensions:
# score_threshold = 0.9


# Create and run pipeline
pipeline = SelfImprovingCoTPipeline(
    reason_agent=reason_agent,
    problems=problems,  # Pass problems list directly
    output_path=output_path,
    max_iterations=2,
    batch_size=100, # Size of batch to process the data (optional)
    evaluate_agent=evaluate_agent, # To use evaluate agent(optional)
    score_threshold=score_threshold, # Score thresholds for agent evaluation (optional)
    # reward_model=reward_model,  # To use a reward model (optional)
)
print("Start generation! May take some time, please wait..")
results = pipeline.generate(rationalization=True)

end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time

print(f"\nProcessed {len(results)} problems")
print(f"Results saved to: {output_path}")
print(f"Total execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Let's take a look at generated reasoning data!


```python
with open('generated_data.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```

##  üì§ Upload the Data to Hugging Face
