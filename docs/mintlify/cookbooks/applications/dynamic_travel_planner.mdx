## üì¶ Installation

First, install the CAMEL package with all its dependencies:


```python
!pip install "camel-ai[all]==0.2.16"
```

## üîë Setting Up API Keys

You'll need to set up your API keys for OpenAI, Dappier and AgentOps.
This ensures that the tools can interact with external services securely.

You can go to [here](https://platform.dappier.com/profile/api-keys) to get API Key from Dappier with **free** credits.


```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Prompt for the Dappier API key securely
dappier_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["DAPPIER_API_KEY"] = dappier_api_key
```

Your can go to [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) to get API Key from Open AI.


```python
# Prompt for the API key securely
openai_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = openai_api_key
```

You can go to [here](https://app.agentops.ai/signin) to get **free** API Key from AgentOps



```python
# Prompt for the AgentOps API key securely
agentops_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["AGENTOPS_API_KEY"] = agentops_api_key
```

Alternatively, if running on Colab, you could save your API keys and tokens as **Colab Secrets**, and use them across notebooks.

To do so, **comment out** the above **manual** API key prompt code block(s), and **uncomment** the following codeblock.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget granting access to the API key you would be using to the current notebook.


```python
# import os
# from google.colab import userdata

# os.environ["DAPPIER_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("DAPPIER_API_KEY")
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
# os.environ["AGENTOPS_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("AGENTOPS_API_KEY")
```

Set up the OpenAI GPT4o-mini using the CAMEL ModelFactory. You can also configure other models as needed.


```python
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
from camel.configs import ChatGPTConfig

# Set up model
openai_gpt4o_mini = ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
    model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
    model_config_dict=ChatGPTConfig(temperature=0.2).as_dict(),
)
```

## üìπ Monitoring AI Agents with AgentOps


```python
import agentops
agentops.init(default_tags=["CAMEL cookbook"])
```

## üõ∞Ô∏è Access Real Time Data with Dappier

Dappier is a powerful tool that connects LLMs to real-time, rights-cleared data from trusted sources, specializing in domains like web search, finance, and news. It delivers enriched, prompt-ready data, empowering AI with verified and up-to-date information for diverse applications. In this section, we will search for the latest news related to CAMEL AI as an example.


```python
from camel.toolkits import DappierToolkit

# Search for real time data from a given user query.
response = DappierToolkit().search_real_time_data(
    query="latest news on CAMEL AI"
)

print(response)
```

üéâ **Dappier effortlessly retrieves the latest news on CAMEL AI, providing valuable data for AI integration!**

## ü§ñü§ñ  Multi-Agent Role-Playing with CAMEL

*This section sets up a role-playing session where AI agents interact to accomplish a task using Dappier tool. We will guide the assistant agent in creating a dynamic travel plan by leveraging real-time weather data.*


```python
from typing import List

from colorama import Fore

from camel.agents.chat_agent import FunctionCallingRecord
from camel.societies import RolePlaying
from camel.toolkits import FunctionTool
from camel.utils import print_text_animated
```

Defining the Task Prompt


```python
task_prompt = """Generate a 2-day travel itinerary for New York City, tailored to the real-time weather forecast for the upcoming weekend. Follow these steps:

Determine Current Date and Weekend:
Use Dappier's real-time search to identify the current date and day. Calculate the dates of the upcoming weekend based on this information.

Fetch Weather Data:
Retrieve the weather forecast for the identified weekend dates to understand the conditions for each day.

Design the Itinerary:
Use the weather insights to plan activities and destinations that suit the expected conditions. For each suggested location:

Verify whether it is free to visit or requires advance booking.
Check current traffic conditions to estimate travel times and feasibility.
Output:
Present a detailed 2-day itinerary, including timing, activities, and travel considerations. Ensure the plan is optimized for convenience and enjoyment.
"""
```

We will configure the assistant agent with tools for real-time weather data
retrieval.


```python
dappier_tool = FunctionTool(DappierToolkit().search_real_time_data)

tool_list = [
    dappier_tool
]

assistant_model_config = ChatGPTConfig(
    tools=tool_list,
    temperature=0.0,
)
```

Setting Up the Role-Playing Session


```python
# Initialize the role-playing session
role_play_session = RolePlaying(
    assistant_role_name="CAMEL Assistant",
    user_role_name="CAMEL User",
    assistant_agent_kwargs=dict(
        model=ModelFactory.create(
            model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
            model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
            model_config_dict=assistant_model_config.as_dict(),
        ),
        tools=tool_list,
    ),
    user_agent_kwargs=dict(model=openai_gpt4o_mini),
    task_prompt=task_prompt,
    with_task_specify=False,
)
```

Print the system message and task prompt


```python
# Print system and task messages
print(
    Fore.GREEN
    + f"AI Assistant sys message:\n{role_play_session.assistant_sys_msg}\n"
)
print(Fore.BLUE + f"AI User sys message:\n{role_play_session.user_sys_msg}\n")

print(Fore.YELLOW + f"Original task prompt:\n{task_prompt}\n")
```

Set the termination rule and start the interaction between agents

**NOTE**: This session will take approximately 6 minutes and will consume around 60k tokens by using GPT4o-mini.


```python
n = 0
input_msg = role_play_session.init_chat()
while n < 20: # Limit the chat to 20 turns
    n += 1
    assistant_response, user_response = role_play_session.step(input_msg)

    if assistant_response.terminated:
        print(
            Fore.GREEN
            + (
                "AI Assistant terminated. Reason: "
                f"{assistant_response.info['termination_reasons']}."
            )
        )
        break
    if user_response.terminated:
        print(
            Fore.GREEN
            + (
                "AI User terminated. "
                f"Reason: {user_response.info['termination_reasons']}."
            )
        )
        break
    # Print output from the user
    print_text_animated(
        Fore.BLUE + f"AI User:\n\n{user_response.msg.content}\n",
        0.01
    )

    if "CAMEL_TASK_DONE" in user_response.msg.content:
        break

    # Print output from the assistant, including any function
    # execution information
    print_text_animated(Fore.GREEN + "AI Assistant:", 0.01)
    tool_calls: List[FunctionCallingRecord] = [
        FunctionCallingRecord(**call.as_dict())
        for call in assistant_response.info['tool_calls']
    ]
    for func_record in tool_calls:
        print_text_animated(f"{func_record}", 0.01)
    print_text_animated(f"{assistant_response.msg.content}\n", 0.01)

    input_msg = assistant_response.msg
```


```python
# End the AgentOps session
agentops.end_session("Success")
```

üéâ Go to the AgentOps link shown above, you will be able to see the detailed record for this running like below.

**NOTE**: The AgentOps link is private and tied to the AgentOps account. To access the link, you'll need to run the session using your own AgentOps API Key, which will then allow you to open the link with the session's running information.
