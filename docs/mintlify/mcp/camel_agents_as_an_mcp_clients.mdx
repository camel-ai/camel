This guide walks you through turning your CAMEL AI agent into an MCP client—letting your agent easily use tools from multiple MCP servers.

## Quick Setup Steps

1. **Create a Config File**: Tell CAMEL which MCP servers you want to connect to.
2. **Use MCPToolkit to Connect**: Load your config file to connect to the servers.
3. **Enable Tools in CAMEL Agent**: Pass the server tools to your CAMEL agent to use.

This guide walks you through turning your CAMEL AI agent into an MCP client—letting your agent easily use tools from multiple MCP servers.

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>

  <Step title="Step 1: Configure MCP Servers">
    Start by creating a config file that tells your CAMEL agent what MCP servers to connect to. You can define local or remote servers, each with a transport method.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Local Server (stdio)">
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "time_server": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["time_server.py"],
            "transport": "stdio"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Remote Server (streamable-http)">
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "composio-notion": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["composio-core@rc", "mcp", "https://mcp.composio.dev/notion/your-server-id", "--client", "camel"],
            "env": {
              "COMPOSIO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
            },
            "transport": "streamable-http"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="ACI.dev Server (sse)">
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "aci_apps": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
              "aci-mcp",
              "apps-server",
              "--apps=BRAVE_SEARCH,GITHUB,ARXIV",
              "--linked-account-owner-id",
              "<your_linked_acc_owner_id>"
            ],
            "env": {
              "ACI_API_KEY": "your_aci_api_key"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Connect & Build the Agent">
    Use `MCPToolkit` to connect to the servers and pass the tools to your CAMEL agent.

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from camel.toolkits.mcp_toolkit import MCPToolkit
    from camel.agents import ChatAgent

    async def main():
        toolkit = MCPToolkit(config_path="config/time.json")
        await toolkit.connect()
        agent = ChatAgent(model=model, tools=toolkit.get_tools())
        response = await agent.astep("What time is it now?")
        print(response.msgs[0].content)
        await toolkit.disconnect()

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Add More Tools & Debug">
    Once connected, you can extend your setup with other servers from ACI.dev, Composio, or `npx`.  

    <Note type="info">
    - Use `stdio` for local testing, `sse` or `streamable-http` for cloud tools.
    - Secure your API keys using the `env` field in the config.
    - Use the MCP Inspector (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) if you run into issues.

    Try plugging in servers like GitHub, Notion, or ArXiv and see your CAMEL agent in action.
    </Note>

## How It Works – System Diagram

<Card title="CAMEL Agent as an MCP Client" img="/images/camel_toolks_as_mcp_server.png">
This diagram illustrates how CAMEL agents use MCPToolkit to seamlessly connect with MCP servers. Servers provide external tools from platforms like GitHub, Gmail, Notion, and more.

## Using Transport Methods

- **stdio**: Ideal for local servers. Fast and easy.
- **sse**: Great for cloud-hosted servers like ACI.dev.
- **streamable-http**: Recommended for modern cloud integrations.

## Tips to Keep in Mind

- Start local with `stdio` servers, then scale up.
- Store your API keys securely in the config file, never in code.
- Use the MCP Inspector tool (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`) for debugging.

## Give It a Go

Try setting up a config file for an MCP server (like GitHub or Notion) and see your CAMEL agent use the new tools right away!
