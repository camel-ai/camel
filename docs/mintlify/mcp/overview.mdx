## What is MCP all about?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) originated from an [Anthropic article](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-the-model-context-protocol) published on November 25, 2024: *Introducing the Model Context Protocol*.

MCP defines **how applications and AI models exchange contextual information**.  
It enables developers to connect data sources, tools, and functions to LLMs using a universal, standardized protocol—much like USB-C enables diverse devices to connect via a single interface.

  <Card title="Universal Standard" icon="universal-access">
    MCP aims to be the "USB-C for AI": one protocol, endless integrations. Plug in any tool or data source—LLM models just work with it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Layer of Abstraction" icon="layer-group">
    Sits between LLMs and external tools/data, so you can add capabilities and context without changing agent code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flexible & Language-Agnostic" icon="language">
    MCP servers can be built in any language, run anywhere, and connect to anything—from cloud APIs to local files.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent Developer Experience" icon="puzzle">
    Write your agent logic once, then extend it with new plugins or data via MCP, just by registering a new server.

  **MCP’s goal:**  
  Create a universal standard that makes building, connecting, and maintaining AI applications simpler and more unified.

## Visualizing MCP

Here’s how MCP acts as an **intermediate protocol layer** between LLMs and tools:

A simpler illustration of MCP’s benefits:

**Key Takeaway:**  
MCP reduces the integration mess—tools and models only need to support MCP, not each other!

## Why introduce MCP?

<Info>
**Seamless Agent Integration:**  
MCP was designed by Anthropic to solve the challenge of connecting context, data, and tools to LLMs in a clean, unified way.  
</Info>

- **Ecosystem**: Leverage a growing library of MCP plugins—just plug them in.
- **Uniformity**: Not limited to any one model or vendor; if your agent supports MCP, you can swap models/tools anytime.
- **Data Security**: Keep sensitive data on your device. MCP servers decide what to expose—your private data never needs to leave your machine.

## MCP Architecture and Principles

**Basic Architecture**

MCP follows a **client-server model** with three main roles:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="MCP Host" icon="message-quote">
    Applications like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that need external data/tools. The "Host" is the user-facing app.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Client" icon="signal-stream">
    Built into the Host, the MCP Client manages protocol communication and connects to MCP Servers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Server" icon="server">
    Lightweight services (local or remote) that expose specific functions (e.g., read files, search web) via the MCP protocol.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

- **Local Data Sources**: Files, folders, databases, and services MCP servers can securely access.
- **Remote Services**: Online APIs and cloud platforms accessible to MCP servers.

### How it works—step by step:

1. **User asks:**  
   “What documents do I have on my desktop?” via the Host (e.g., Claude Desktop).

2. **Host (MCP Host):**  
   Receives your question and forwards it to the Claude model.

3. **Client (MCP Client):**  
   Claude model decides it needs more data—Client is activated to connect to a file system MCP Server.

4. **Server (MCP Server):**  
   The server reads your desktop directory and returns a list of documents.

5. **Results:**  
   Claude uses this info to answer your question—displayed in your desktop app.

This architecture **lets agents dynamically call tools and access data**—local or remote—while developers only focus on building the relevant MCPServer.  
**You don’t have to handle the nitty-gritty of connecting Hosts and Clients.**

## At a Glance

- **MCP** standardizes and simplifies agent-to-tool connections.
- **Developers** build or reuse MCP servers, not custom integrations for every agent.
- **Users** get safer, more flexible, and privacy-friendly AI workflows.
