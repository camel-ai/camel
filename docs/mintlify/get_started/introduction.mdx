## What is CAMEL-AI?

**CAMEL‑AI is an open‑source, modular framework for building intelligent multi‑agent systems.** It provides the primitives to:

- Create **Agents** that reason, plan, and act
- Compose **Societies** of agents with defined roles
- Integrate **Interpreters** for code execution and analysis
- Manage **Memory** for long‑horizon context and learning
- Orchestrate **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines
- Generate **Synthetic Data** at scale with self‑instruct and verifier loops
- Simulate **Worlds** and agent interactions in environments like social networks

## Core Components

- **Agents**: Atomic reasoning units driven by LLMs, capable of tool calls and decision‑making
- **Societies**: Coordinator layers that assign roles, delegate tasks, and manage collaboration
- **Interpreters**: Execution backends (Python, shell, browsers) for live code evaluation and automation
- **Memory & Storage**: Persistent context layers for chat history, tool outputs, and learned knowledge
- **RAG Pipelines**: Combine chunking, retrieval, and generation for grounded, accurate responses
- **Synthetic Data Engines**: Self‑instruct, Chain‑of‑Thought, and Source2Synth pipelines with verifiers
- **World Simulation**: Platforms like Oasis for large‑scale multi‑agent social simulations
- **Task Automation**: Benchmarks like CRAB for real‑world multi‑step software workflows
