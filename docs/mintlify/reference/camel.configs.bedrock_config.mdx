## BedrockConfig

```python
class BedrockConfig(BaseConfig):
```

Defines the parameters for generating chat completions using OpenAI
compatibility.

**Parameters:**

- **max_tokens** (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **temperature** (float, optional): Sampling temperature to use, between :obj:`0` and :obj:`2`. Higher values make the output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **top_p** (float, optional): An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So :obj:`0.1` means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **top_k** (int, optional): The number of top tokens to consider.
- **stream** (bool, optional): If True, partial message deltas will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **tools** (list[FunctionTool], optional): A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
- **tool_choice** (Union[dict[str, str], str], optional): Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. :obj:`"none"` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. :obj:`"auto"` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. :obj:`"required"` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool. :obj:`"none"` is the default when no tools are present. :obj:`"auto"` is the default if tools are present.
- **reasoning_effort** (str, optional): A parameter specifying the level of reasoning used by certain model types. Valid values are :obj: `"low"`, :obj:`"medium"`, or :obj:`"high"`. If set, it is only applied to the model types that support it (e.g., :obj:`o1`, :obj:`o1mini`, :obj:`o1preview`, :obj:`o3mini`). If not provided or if the model type does not support it, this parameter is ignored. (default: :obj:`None`)
