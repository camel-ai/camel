## CohereConfig

```python
class CohereConfig(BaseConfig):
```

Defines the parameters for generating chat completions using the
Cohere API.

**Parameters:**

- **temperature** (float, optional): Sampling temperature to use, between :obj:`0` and :obj:`2`. Higher values make the output more random, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **documents** (list, optional): A list of relevant documents that the model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is either a string or document object with content and metadata. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **max_tokens** (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens the model will generate as part of the response. (default: :obj:`None`) stop_sequences (List(str), optional): A list of up to 5 strings that the model will use to stop generation. If the model generates a string that matches any of the strings in the list, it will stop generating tokens and return the generated text up to that point not including the stop sequence. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **seed** (int, optional): If specified, the backend will make a best effort to sample tokens deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. However, determinism cannot be totally guaranteed. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **frequency_penalty** (float, optional): Min value of `0.0`, max value of `1.0`. Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. The higher the value, the stronger a penalty is applied to previously present tokens, proportional to how many times they have already appeared in the prompt or prior generation. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **presence_penalty** (float, optional): Min value of `0.0`, max value of `1.0`. Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. Similar to `frequency_penalty`, except that this penalty is applied equally to all tokens that have already appeared, regardless of their exact frequencies. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **k** (int, optional): Ensures only the top k most likely tokens are considered for generation at each step. Min value of `0`, max value of `500`. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **p** (float, optional): Ensures that only the most likely tokens, with total probability mass of `p`, are considered for generation at each step. If both k and p are enabled, `p` acts after `k`. Min value of `0.01`, max value of `0.99`. (default: :obj:`None`)
