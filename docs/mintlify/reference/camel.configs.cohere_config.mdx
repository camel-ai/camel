## CohereConfig Objects

```python
class CohereConfig(BaseConfig)
```

Defines the parameters for generating chat completions using the
Cohere API.

**Arguments**:

- `temperature` _float, optional_ - Sampling temperature to use, between
  :obj:`0` and :obj:`2`. Higher values make the output more random,
  while lower values make it more focused and deterministic.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `documents` _list, optional_ - A list of relevant documents that the
  model can cite to generate a more accurate reply. Each document is
  either a string or document object with content and metadata.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `max_tokens` _int, optional_ - The maximum number of tokens the model
  will generate as part of the response. (default: :obj:`None`)
  stop_sequences (List(str), optional): A list of up to 5 strings that
  the model will use to stop generation. If the model generates a
  string that matches any of the strings in the list, it will stop
  generating tokens and return the generated text up to that point
  not including the stop sequence. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `seed` _int, optional_ - If specified, the backend will make a best
  effort to sample tokens deterministically, such that repeated
  requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same
  result. However, determinism cannot be totally guaranteed.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `frequency_penalty` _float, optional_ - Min value of `0.0`, max value of
  `1.0`. Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. The
  higher the value, the stronger a penalty is applied to previously
  present tokens, proportional to how many times they have already
  appeared in the prompt or prior generation.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `presence_penalty` _float, optional_ - Min value of `0.0`, max value of
  `1.0`. Used to reduce repetitiveness of generated tokens. Similar
  to `frequency_penalty`, except that this penalty is applied
  equally to all tokens that have already appeared, regardless of
  their exact frequencies. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `k` _int, optional_ - Ensures only the top k most likely tokens are
  considered for generation at each step. Min value of `0`, max
  value of `500`. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `p` _float, optional_ - Ensures that only the most likely tokens, with
  total probability mass of `p`, are considered for generation at
  each step. If both k and p are enabled, `p` acts after `k`. Min
  value of `0.01`, max value of `0.99`. (default: :obj:`None`)
