## AIMLConfig

```python
class AIMLConfig(BaseConfig):
```

Defines the parameters for generating chat completions using the
AIML API.

**Parameters:**

- **temperature** (float, optional): Determines the degree of randomness in the response. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **top_p** (float, optional): The top_p (nucleus) parameter is used to dynamically adjust the number of choices for each predicted token based on the cumulative probabilities. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **n** (int, optional): Number of generations to return. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **response_format** (object, optional): An object specifying the format that the model must output.
- **stream** (bool, optional): If set, tokens are returned as Server-Sent Events as they are made available. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **stop** (str or list, optional): Up to :obj:`4` sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **max_tokens** (int, optional): The maximum number of tokens to generate. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **logit_bias** (dict, optional): Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from :obj:`-100` to :obj:`100`. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between:obj:` -1`
- **and**: obj:`1` should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like :obj:`-100` or :obj:`100` should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **frequency_penalty** (float, optional): Number between :obj:`-2.0` and :obj:`2.0`. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. See more information about frequency and presence penalties. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **presence_penalty** (float, optional): Number between :obj:`-2.0` and :obj:`2.0`. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. See more information about frequency and presence penalties. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **tools** (list[FunctionTool], optional): A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
