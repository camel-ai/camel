## DeductiveReasonerAgent

```python
class DeductiveReasonerAgent(ChatAgent):
```

An agent responsible for deductive reasoning. Model of deductive
reasoning:
- L: A âŠ• C -> q * B
- A represents the known starting state.
- B represents the known target state.
- C represents the conditions required to transition from A to B.
- Q represents the quality or effectiveness of the transition from
A to B.
- L represents the path or process from A to B.

**Parameters:**

- **model** (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for generating responses. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)

### __init__

```python
def __init__(self, model: Optional[BaseModelBackend] = None):
```

<a id="camel.agents.deductive_reasoner_agent.DeductiveReasonerAgent.deduce_conditions_and_quality"></a>

### deduce_conditions_and_quality

```python
def deduce_conditions_and_quality(
    self,
    starting_state: str,
    target_state: str,
    role_descriptions_dict: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None
):
```

Derives the conditions and quality from the starting state and the
target state based on the model of the deductive reasoning and the
knowledge base. It can optionally consider the roles involved in the
scenario, which allows tailoring the output more closely to the AI
agent's environment.

**Parameters:**

- **starting_state** (str): The initial or starting state from which conditions are deduced.
- **target_state** (str): The target state of the task.
- **role_descriptions_dict** (Optional[Dict[str, str]], optional): The descriptions of the roles. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **role_descriptions_dict** (Optional[Dict[str, str]], optional): A dictionary describing the roles involved in the scenario. This is optional and can be used to provide a context for the CAMEL's role-playing, enabling the generation of more relevant and tailored conditions and quality assessments. This could be generated using a `RoleAssignmentAgent()` or defined manually by the user.

**Returns:**

  Dict[str, Union[List[str], Dict[str, str]]]: A dictionary with the
extracted data from the message. The dictionary contains three
keys:
- 'conditions': A list where each key is a condition ID and
each value is the corresponding condition text.
- 'labels': A list of label strings extracted from the message.
- 'quality': A string of quality assessment strings extracted
from the message.
