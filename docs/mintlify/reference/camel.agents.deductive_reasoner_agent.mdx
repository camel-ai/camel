## DeductiveReasonerAgent Objects

```python
@track_agent(name="DeductiveReasonerAgent")
class DeductiveReasonerAgent(ChatAgent)
```

An agent responsible for deductive reasoning. Model of deductive
reasoning:
- L: A âŠ• C -> q * B
- A represents the known starting state.
- B represents the known target state.
- C represents the conditions required to transition from A to B.
- Q represents the quality or effectiveness of the transition from
A to B.
- L represents the path or process from A to B.

**Arguments**:

- `model` _BaseModelBackend, optional_ - The model backend to use for
  generating responses. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with
  `GPT_4O_MINI`)

#### deduce\_conditions\_and\_quality

```python
def deduce_conditions_and_quality(
    starting_state: str,
    target_state: str,
    role_descriptions_dict: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Union[List[str], Dict[str, str]]]
```

Derives the conditions and quality from the starting state and the
target state based on the model of the deductive reasoning and the
knowledge base. It can optionally consider the roles involved in the
scenario, which allows tailoring the output more closely to the AI
agent's environment.

**Arguments**:

- `starting_state` _str_ - The initial or starting state from which
  conditions are deduced.
- `target_state` _str_ - The target state of the task.
- `role_descriptions_dict` _Optional[Dict[str, str]], optional_ - The
  descriptions of the roles. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `role_descriptions_dict` _Optional[Dict[str, str]], optional_ - A
  dictionary describing the roles involved in the scenario. This
  is optional and can be used to provide a context for the
  CAMEL's role-playing, enabling the generation of more relevant
  and tailored conditions and quality assessments. This could be
  generated using a `RoleAssignmentAgent()` or defined manually
  by the user.
  

**Returns**:

  Dict[str, Union[List[str], Dict[str, str]]]: A dictionary with the
  extracted data from the message. The dictionary contains three
  keys:
  - 'conditions': A list where each key is a condition ID and
  each value is the corresponding condition text.
  - 'labels': A list of label strings extracted from the message.
  - 'quality': A string of quality assessment strings extracted
  from the message.
