## ChatHistoryBlock

```python
class ChatHistoryBlock(MemoryBlock):
```

An implementation of the :obj:`MemoryBlock` abstract base class for
maintaining a record of chat histories.

This memory block helps manage conversation histories with a key-value
storage backend, either provided by the user or using a default
in-memory storage. It offers a windowed approach to retrieving chat
histories, allowing users to specify how many recent messages they'd
like to fetch.

**Parameters:**

- **storage** (BaseKeyValueStorage, optional): A storage mechanism for storing chat history. If `None`, an :obj:`InMemoryKeyValueStorage` will be used. (default: :obj:`None`)
- **keep_rate** (float, optional): In historical messages, the score of the last message is 1.0, and with each step taken backward, the score of the message is multiplied by the `keep_rate`. Higher `keep_rate` leads to high possibility to keep history messages during context creation.

def __init__(
    self,
    storage: Optional[BaseKeyValueStorage] = None,
    keep_rate: float = 0.9
):
```

### retrieve

```python
def retrieve(self, window_size: Optional[int] = None):
```

Retrieves records with a proper size for the agent from the memory
based on the window size or fetches the entire chat history if no
window size is specified.

**Parameters:**

- **window_size** (int, optional): Specifies the number of recent chat messages to retrieve. If not provided, the entire chat history will be retrieved. (default: :obj:`None`)

**Returns:**

  List[ContextRecord]: A list of retrieved records.

### write_records

```python
def write_records(self, records: List[MemoryRecord]):
```

Writes memory records to the memory. Additionally, performs
validation checks on the messages.

**Parameters:**

- **records** (List[MemoryRecord]): Memory records to be added to the memory.

### clear

```python
def clear(self):
```

Clears all chat messages from the memory.
