## _query_unimplemented

```python
def _query_unimplemented(self, *input: Any):
```

Defines the query behavior performed at every call.

Query the results. Subclasses should implement this
method according to their specific needs.

It should be overridden by all subclasses.

.. note::
Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within
this function, one should call the :class:`BaseRetriever` instance
afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the
registered hooks while the latter silently ignores them.

## _process_unimplemented

```python
def _process_unimplemented(self, *input: Any):
```

Defines the process behavior performed at every call.

Processes content from a file or URL, divides it into chunks by
using `Unstructured IO`,then stored internally. This method must be
called before executing queries with the retriever.

Should be overridden by all subclasses.

.. note::
Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within
this function, one should call the :class:`BaseRetriever` instance
afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the
registered hooks while the latter silently ignores them.

## BaseRetriever

```python
class BaseRetriever(ABC):
```

Abstract base class for implementing various types of information
retrievers.
