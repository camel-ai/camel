## OpenAPIToolkit

```python
class OpenAPIToolkit:
```

A class representing a toolkit for interacting with OpenAPI APIs.

This class provides methods for interacting with APIs based on OpenAPI
specifications. It dynamically generates functions for each API operation
defined in the OpenAPI specification, allowing users to make HTTP requests
to the API endpoints.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.parse_openapi_file"></a>

### parse_openapi_file

```python
def parse_openapi_file(self, openapi_spec_path: str):
```

Load and parse an OpenAPI specification file.

This function utilizes the `prance.ResolvingParser` to parse and
resolve the given OpenAPI specification file, returning the parsed
OpenAPI specification as a dictionary.

**Parameters:**

- **openapi_spec_path** (str): The file path or URL to the OpenAPI specification.

**Returns:**

  Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: The parsed OpenAPI specification
as a dictionary. :obj:`None` if the package is not installed.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.openapi_spec_to_openai_schemas"></a>

### openapi_spec_to_openai_schemas

```python
def openapi_spec_to_openai_schemas(self, api_name: str, openapi_spec: Dict[str, Any]):
```

Convert OpenAPI specification to OpenAI schema format.

This function iterates over the paths and operations defined in an
OpenAPI specification, filtering out deprecated operations. For each
operation, it constructs a schema in a format suitable for OpenAI,
including operation metadata such as function name, description,
parameters, and request bodies. It raises a ValueError if an operation
lacks a description or summary.

**Parameters:**

- **api_name** (str): The name of the API, used to prefix generated function names.
- **openapi_spec** (Dict[str, Any]): The OpenAPI specification as a dictionary.

**Returns:**

  List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries, each representing a
function in the OpenAI schema format, including details about
the function's name, description, and parameters.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.openapi_function_decorator"></a>

### openapi_function_decorator

```python
def openapi_function_decorator(
    self,
    api_name: str,
    base_url: str,
    path: str,
    method: str,
    openapi_security: List[Dict[str, Any]],
    sec_schemas: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]],
    operation: Dict[str, Any]
):
```

Decorate a function to make HTTP requests based on OpenAPI
specification details.

This decorator dynamically constructs and executes an API request based
on the provided OpenAPI operation specifications, security
requirements, and parameters.  It supports operations secured with
`apiKey` type security schemes and automatically injects the necessary
API keys from environment variables. Parameters in `path`, `query`,
`header`, and `cookie` are also supported.

**Parameters:**

- **api_name** (str): The name of the API, used to retrieve API key names and URLs from the configuration.
- **base_url** (str): The base URL for the API.
- **path** (str): The path for the API endpoint, relative to the base URL.
- **method** (str): The HTTP method (e.g., 'get', 'post') for the request.
- **openapi_security** (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The global security definitions as specified in the OpenAPI specs.
- **sec_schemas** (Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]): Detailed security schemes.
- **operation** (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing the OpenAPI operation details, including parameters and request body definitions.

**Returns:**

  Callable: A decorator that, when applied to a function, enables the
function to make HTTP requests based on the provided OpenAPI
operation details.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.generate_openapi_funcs"></a>

### generate_openapi_funcs

```python
def generate_openapi_funcs(self, api_name: str, openapi_spec: Dict[str, Any]):
```

Generates a list of Python functions based on
OpenAPI specification.

This function dynamically creates a list of callable functions that
represent the API operations defined in an OpenAPI specification
document. Each function is designed to perform an HTTP request
corresponding to an API operation (e.g., GET, POST) as defined in
the specification. The functions are decorated with
`openapi_function_decorator`, which configures them to construct and
send the HTTP requests with appropriate parameters, headers, and body
content.

**Parameters:**

- **api_name** (str): The name of the API, used to prefix generated function names.
- **openapi_spec** (Dict[str, Any]): The OpenAPI specification as a dictionary.

**Returns:**

  List[Callable]: A list containing the generated functions. Each
function, when called, will make an HTTP request according to
its corresponding API operation defined in the OpenAPI
specification.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.apinames_filepaths_to_funs_schemas"></a>

### apinames_filepaths_to_funs_schemas

```python
def apinames_filepaths_to_funs_schemas(self, apinames_filepaths: List[Tuple[str, str]]):
```

Combines functions and schemas from multiple OpenAPI
specifications, using API names as keys.

This function iterates over tuples of API names and OpenAPI spec file
paths, parsing each spec to generate callable functions and schema
dictionaries, all organized by API name.

**Parameters:**

- **apinames_filepaths** (List[Tuple[str, str]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of: - The API name (str) as the first element. - The file path (str) to the API's OpenAPI specification file as the second element.

**Returns:**

  Tuple[List[Callable], List[Dict[str, Any]]]:: one of callable
functions for API operations, and another of dictionaries
representing the schemas from the specifications.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.generate_apinames_filepaths"></a>

### generate_apinames_filepaths

```python
def generate_apinames_filepaths(self):
```

**Returns:**

  List[Tuple[str, str]]: A list of tuples where each tuple contains
two elements. The first element of each tuple is a string
representing the name of an API, and the second element is a
string that specifies the file path to that API's OpenAPI
specification file.

<a id="camel.toolkits.open_api_toolkit.OpenAPIToolkit.get_tools"></a>

### get_tools

```python
def get_tools(self):
```

**Returns:**

  List[FunctionTool]: A list of FunctionTool objects
representing the functions in the toolkit.
