## SlackAuthProfile

```python
class SlackAuthProfile(BaseModel):
```

Represents the authorization profile within a Slack event.

Events will contain a single, compact authorizations field that shows one
installation of your app that the event is visible to.
In other words, lists of authorizations will be truncated to one element.

If there's more than one installing party that your app is keeping track
of, it's best not to rely on the single party listed in authorizations to
be any particular one.

To get a full list of who can see events, call the apps.event.
authorizations.list method after obtaining an app-level token. Read more on
the changes here; they have taken effect for existing apps as of
February 24, 2021.
