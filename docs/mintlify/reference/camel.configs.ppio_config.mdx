## PPIOConfig Objects

```python
class PPIOConfig(BaseConfig)
```

Defines the parameters for generating chat completions using the
OpenAI API.

**Arguments**:

- `temperature` _float, optional_ - Sampling temperature to use, between
  :obj:`0` and :obj:`2`. Higher values make the output more random,
  while lower values make it more focused and deterministic.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `top_p` _float, optional_ - An alternative to sampling with temperature,
  called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of
  the tokens with top_p probability mass. So :obj:`0.1` means only
  the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `n` _int, optional_ - How many chat completion choices to generate for
  each input message. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `response_format` _object, optional_ - An object specifying the format
  that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all
  GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. Setting to
- `{"type"` - "json_object"} enables JSON mode, which guarantees the
  message the model generates is valid JSON. Important: when using
  JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON
  yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model
  may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation
  reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly
  "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be
  partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the
  generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the
  max context length.
- `stream` _bool, optional_ - If True, partial message deltas will be sent
  as data-only server-sent events as they become available.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `stop` _str or list, optional_ - Up to :obj:`4` sequences where the API
  will stop generating further tokens. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `max_tokens` _int, optional_ - The maximum number of tokens to generate
  in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and
  generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `presence_penalty` _float, optional_ - Number between :obj:`-2.0` and
  :obj:`2.0`. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether
  they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood
  to talk about new topics. See more information about frequency and
  presence penalties. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `frequency_penalty` _float, optional_ - Number between :obj:`-2.0` and
  :obj:`2.0`. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
  existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's
  likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. See more information
  about frequency and presence penalties. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `logit_bias` _dict, optional_ - Modify the likelihood of specified tokens
  appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens
  (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated
  bias value from :obj:`-100` to :obj:`100`. Mathematically, the bias
  is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between:obj:` -1`
  and :obj:`1` should decrease or increase likelihood of selection;
  values like :obj:`-100` or :obj:`100` should result in a ban or
  exclusive selection of the relevant token. (default: :obj:`None`)
- `user` _str, optional_ - A unique identifier representing your end-user,
  which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.
- `(default` - :obj:`None`)
- `tools` _list[FunctionTool], optional_ - A list of tools the model may
  call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this
  to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs
  for. A max of 128 functions are supported.
