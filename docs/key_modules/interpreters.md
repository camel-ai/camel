# Interpreters

## 1. Concept
Interpreters are tools that empower the agents to execute given code snippets
on local machine. 

### 1.1. Internal Python Interpreter

### 1.2. Subprocess Interpreter

### 1.3. Docker Interpreter
Yes, we know how disturbing it is to run any code snippets directly on local
system. To avoid this, we have introduced Docker Interpreter. This interpreter 
runs the code snippets in a Docker container, ensuring that all the code is
executed in an isolated environment.

**To utilize this interpreter, you need to have Docker installed on your 
system.** For more information on Docker installation, visit
[Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### 1.4. E2B Interpreter
You could leverage the E2B sandbox to run the code.
