        "It's built on a client-server setup: the **client** (your LLM or agent) talks to the server (where the tools live). When you need something beyond the LLM's cutoff knowledge, like up-to-date docs, it doesn't flounder. It pings the MCP server, grabs the right function's details, runs it, and delivers the answer in plain English.\n",

Manage accounts, API keys, and settings in one hub. Just add apps from the ACI App Store, enable them in Project Settings, and link them with a single linked-account-owner-id. Done.\n"
