        "The `ChatAgent()` class is a cornerstone of CAMEL üê´. We design our agent with the spirit to answer the following question:\n",

        "> Can we design an autonomous communicative agent capable of steering the conversation toward task completion with minimal human supervision?\n",
        "\n",
        "In our current implementation, we consider agents with the following key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Role**: along with the goal and content specification, this sets the initial state of an agent, guiding the agent to take actions during the sequential interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: each agent utilizes a Large Language Model to enhance cognitive capabilities. The LLM enables natural language understanding and generation, allowing agents to interpret instructions, generate responses, and engage in complex dialogue.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory**: in-context memory and external memory which allows the agent to infer and learn in a more grounded approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tools**: a set of functions that our agents can utilize to interact with the external world; essentially this gives embodiments to our agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Communication**: our framework allows flexible and scalable communication between agents. This is fundamental for the critical research question.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reasoning**: we will equip agents with different planning and reward (critic) learning abilities, allowing them to optimize task completion in a more guided approach."
