## Introduction

The key difference between humans and animals lies in the human ability to create and use tools, allowing us to shape the world beyond natural limits. Similarly, in AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) enable agents to utilize external tools, acting as extensions of their capabilities. These tools, each with a specific name, purpose, input, and output, empower agents to perform tasks otherwise impossible.

This tutorial will show you how to use tools integrated by CAMEL and how to customize your own tools.

## Tool Usage of a Single Agent

A single agent can utilize multiple tools to answer questions, take actions, or perform complex tasks. Here you will build an agent using both the supported toolkit in CAMEL and the tool customized by you.

First we are going to take the search tool as an example for utilizing existing tools but you can also see some of the other tools supported by CAMEL below.

### Installation

```bash
pip install "camel-ai[all]==0.2.16"
```

### Import Required Modules

```python
from camel.agents import ChatAgent
from camel.configs import ChatGPTConfig
from camel.toolkits import (
    SearchToolkit,
    # MathToolkit,
    # GoogleMapsToolkit,
    # TwitterToolkit,
    # WeatherToolkit,
    # RetrievalToolkit,
    # TwitterToolkit,
    # SlackToolkit,
    # LinkedInToolkit,
    # RedditToolkit,
)
from camel.messages import BaseMessage
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
```

### Set Up OpenAI Key

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Prompt for the API key securely
openai_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = openai_api_key
```

### Customize Tools

Now you have done that, let's customize a tool by taking the simple math calculator, functions add and sub, as an example. When you define your own function, make sure the argument name and docstring are clear so that the agent can understand what this function can do and when to use the function based on the function information you provide.

> This is just to demonstrate the use of custom tools, the built-in MathToolkit already includes tools for add and sub.

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    r"""Adds two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The first number to be added.
        b (int): The second number to be added.

    Returns:
        integer: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b

def sub(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    r"""Do subtraction between two numbers.

    Args:
        a (int): The minuend in subtraction.
        b (int): The subtrahend in subtraction.

    Returns:
        integer: The result of subtracting :obj:`b` from :obj:`a`.
    """
    return a - b
```

### Add Custom Functions to CAMEL

Add these 2 customized functions as CAMEL's FunctionTool list:

```python
from camel.toolkits import FunctionTool

MATH_FUNCS: list[FunctionTool] = [
    FunctionTool(func) for func in [add, sub]
]
```

### Configure Tools List

Then you can add the tool from CAMEL and the one defined by yourself to the tool list:

```python
tools_list = [
    # *MathToolkit().get_tools(),
    *SearchToolkit().get_tools(),
    *MATH_FUNCS,
]
```

### Initialize ChatAgent

Next let's set the parameters to the agent and initialize ChatAgent to call the tool:

```python
# Set the backend mode, this model should support tool calling
model=ModelFactory.create(
    model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
    model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI
)

# Set message for the assistant
assistant_sys_msg =  """You are a helpful assistant to do search task."""

# Set the agent
agent = ChatAgent(
    assistant_sys_msg,
    model=model,
    tools=tools_list
)
```

### Test the Agent

Here we define two test prompts for the agent, asking about the facts about University of Oxford. Here the agent needs to take advantage of the searching capability to know when University of Oxford is founded and the calculating skills to obtain the estimated age of the Uni.

```python
# Set prompt for the search task
prompt_search = ("""When was University of Oxford set up""")
# Set prompt for the calculation task
prompt_calculate = ("""Assume now is 2024 in the Gregorian calendar, University of Oxford was set up in 1096, estimate the current age of University of Oxford""")

# Convert the two prompt as message that can be accepted by the Agent
user_msg_search = BaseMessage.make_user_message(role_name="User", content=prompt_search)
user_msg_calculate = BaseMessage.make_user_message(role_name="User", content=prompt_calculate)

# Get response
assistant_response_search = agent.step(user_msg_search)
assistant_response_calculate = agent.step(user_msg_calculate)
```

Let's see the agent' performance for answering above questions. The agent should tell you correctly when University of Oxford was set up and its estimated age!

```python
print(assistant_response_search.info['tool_calls'])
print(assistant_response_calculate.info['tool_calls'])
```

## AI Society with Tool Usage

Now you've enabled a single agent to utilize tools, but you can surely take this concept further. Let's establish a small AI ecosystem. This setup will consist of two agents: a user agent and an assistant agent. The assistant agent will be the one we've just configured with tool-using capabilities.

```python
from camel.societies import RolePlaying
from camel.agents.chat_agent import FunctionCallingRecord
from camel.utils import print_text_animated
from colorama import Fore

# Set a task
task_prompt=("Assume now is 2024 in the Gregorian calendar, "
        "estimate the current age of University of Oxford "
        "and then add 10 more years to this age.")

# Set role playing
role_play_session = RolePlaying(
    assistant_role_name="Searcher",
    user_role_name="Professor",
    assistant_agent_kwargs=dict(
        model=ModelFactory.create(
            model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
            model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
        ),
        tools=tools_list,
    ),
    user_agent_kwargs=dict(
        model=ModelFactory.create(
            model_platform=ModelPlatformType.OPENAI,
            model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
        ),
    ),
    task_prompt=task_prompt,
    with_task_specify=False,
)

# Set the limit for the chat turn
chat_turn_limit=10

print(
    Fore.GREEN
    + f"AI Assistant sys message:\n{role_play_session.assistant_sys_msg}\n"
)
print(
    Fore.BLUE + f"AI User sys message:\n{role_play_session.user_sys_msg}\n"
)

print(Fore.YELLOW + f"Original task prompt:\n{task_prompt}\n")
print(
    Fore.CYAN
    + "Specified task prompt:"
    + f"\n{role_play_session.specified_task_prompt}\n"
)
print(Fore.RED + f"Final task prompt:\n{role_play_session.task_prompt}\n")

n = 0
input_msg = role_play_session.init_chat()
while n < chat_turn_limit:
    n += 1
    assistant_response, user_response = role_play_session.step(input_msg)

    if assistant_response.terminated:
        print(
            Fore.GREEN
            + (
                "AI Assistant terminated. Reason: "
                f"{assistant_response.info['termination_reasons']}."
            )
        )
        break
    if user_response.terminated:
        print(
            Fore.GREEN
            + (
                "AI User terminated. "
                f"Reason: {user_response.info['termination_reasons']}."
            )
        )
        break

    # Print output from the user
    print_text_animated(
        Fore.BLUE + f"AI User:\n\n{user_response.msg.content}\n"
    )

    if "CAMEL_TASK_DONE" in user_response.msg.content:
        break

    # Print output from the assistant, including any function
    # execution information
    print_text_animated(Fore.GREEN + "AI Assistant:")
    tool_calls: list[FunctionCallingRecord] = assistant_response.info[
        'tool_calls'
    ]
    for func_record in tool_calls:
        print_text_animated(f"{func_record}")
    print_text_animated(f"{assistant_response.msg.content}\n")

    input_msg = assistant_response.msg
```
