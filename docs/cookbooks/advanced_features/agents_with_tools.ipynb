    "*CAMEL allows AI agents to extend their capabilities by integrating custom tools, similar to how humans use tools to surpass natural limits. This tutorial shows how to set up and customize tools within CAMEL, from basic functions like calculators to creating multi-agent systems that collaborate on tasks. You’ll learn to equip AI agents with the ability to use tools for various tasks, making them more powerful and versatile. Engage with the CAMEL-AI community and explore extensive resources to push the boundaries of AI development. Ready to enhance your AI agents? Dive into the tutorial and start building.*"

    "The key difference between humans and animals lies in the human ability to create and use tools, allowing us to shape the world beyond natural limits. Similarly, in AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) enable agents to utilize external tools, acting as extensions of their capabilities. These tools, each with a specific name, purpose, input, and output, empower agents to perform tasks otherwise impossible.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We anticipate that the integration of custom tool usage within AI agents, as demonstrated through CAMEL, will continue to evolve and expand. This approach not only empowers agents to perform tasks beyond their native capabilities but also fosters collaboration in multi-agent systems. By standardizing the interface for tool usage, CAMEL simplifies the process of customizing and deploying tools across various AI applications, saving time and enhancing versatility. To fully utilize these capabilities, ensure your CAMEL-AI setup is up to date. Dive into the tutorial and start building more powerful AI agents today!"
