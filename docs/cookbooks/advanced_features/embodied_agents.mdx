## Philosophical Bits

We believe the essence of intelligence emerges from its dynamic interactions with the external environment, where the use of various tools becomes a pivotal factor in its development and manifestation.

The `EmbodiedAgent()` in CAMEL is an advanced conversational agent that leverages **code interpreters** and **tool agents** (*e.g.*, `HuggingFaceToolAgent()`) to execute diverse tasks efficiently. This agent represents a blend of advanced programming and AI capabilities, and is able to interact and respond within a dynamic environment.

## Quick Start
Let's first play with a `ChatAgent` instance by simply initialize it with a system message and interact with user messages.

### üïπ Step 0: Preparations


```python
%pip install "camel-ai==0.2.16"
```


```python
from camel.agents import EmbodiedAgent
from camel.generators import SystemMessageGenerator as sys_msg_gen
from camel.messages import BaseMessage as bm
from camel.types import RoleType
```

### Setting Up API Keys

You'll need to set up your API keys for OpenAI.


```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Prompt for the API key securely
openai_api_key = getpass('Enter your API key: ')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = openai_api_key
```

Alternatively, if running on Colab, you could save your API keys and tokens as **Colab Secrets**, and use them across notebooks.

To do so, **comment out** the above **manual** API key prompt code block(s), and **uncomment** the following codeblock.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget granting access to the API key you would be using to the current notebook.


```python
# import os
# from google.colab import userdata

# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

### üïπ Step 1: Define the Role
We first need to set up the necessary information.


```python
# Set the role name and the task
role = 'Programmer'
task = 'Writing and executing codes.'

# Create the meta_dict and the role_tuple
meta_dict = dict(role=role, task=task)
role_tuple = (role, RoleType.EMBODIMENT)
```

The `meta_dict` and `role_type` will be used to generate the system message.



```python
# Generate the system message based on this
sys_msg = sys_msg_gen().from_dict(meta_dict=meta_dict, role_tuple=role_tuple)
```

### üïπ Step 2: Initialize the Agent üê´
Based on the system message, we are ready to initialize our embodied agent.


```python
embodied_agent = EmbodiedAgent(system_message=sys_msg,
                               tool_agents=None,
                               code_interpreter=None,
                               verbose=True)
```

Be aware that the default argument values for `tool_agents` and `code_interpreter` are `None`, and the underlying code interpreter is using the `SubProcessInterpreter()`, which handles the execution of code in Python and Bash within a subprocess.

### üïπ Step 3: Interact with the Agent with `.step()`
Use the base message wrapper to generate the user message.


```python
usr_msg = bm.make_user_message(
    role_name='user',
    content=('1. write a bash script to install numpy. '
             '2. then write a python script to compute '
             'the dot product of [8, 9] and [5, 4], '
             'and print the result. '
             '3. then write a script to search for '
             'the weather at london with wttr.in/london.'))
```

And feed that into your agents:


```python
response = embodied_agent.step(usr_msg)
```

Under the hood, the agent will perform multiple actions within its action space in the OS to fulfill the user request. It will compose code to implement the action ‚Äì no worries, it will ask for your permission before execution.

Ideally you should get the output similar to this, if you allow the agent to perform actions:


```python
print(response.msg.content)
```
