This level of detail is essential for understanding the complexities involved in such an ambitious project.\n",

        "While we see some performance gains from critic-in-the-loop, it may not really solve the fundamental extrapolation problem (and [self-consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) remains a strong baseline for many tasks). It is debatable if those agents can extrapolate by self-play within its current scale. A more practical question is how we may *efficiently* introduce *informative* feedbacks/rewards, when agents are connected with external environments and are endowed with tools and memories. They are expected to have a good world model and know how to make abstraction and analogy when necessary. Stay tuned for our next update."
