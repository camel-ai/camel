With Firecrawl‚Äôs powerful features like Scrape, Crawl, and Map, you can efficiently gather content in formats ready for LLMs to use, directly feeding into CAMEL-AI‚Äôs multi-agent workflows. This setup not only simplifies data collection but also enables more intelligent and insightful agents.\n",
