J. C. R. Licklider, working at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), developed the concept of a universal network. Around the same time, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network using data in message blocks, and Donald Davies conceived the idea of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), advocating for a national commercial data network in the UK.\"\n",
