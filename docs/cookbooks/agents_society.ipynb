    "Currently, the society module aims to enable agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while keeping consistent with human intentions and requiring minimal human intervention. It includes two frameworks: `RolePlaying` and `BabyAGI`, which are used to run the interaction behaviors of agents to achieve objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking `RolePlaying` as an example, this framework was designed in an instruction-following manner. These roles independently undertake the responsibilities of executing and planning tasks, respectively. The dialogue is continuously advanced through a turn-taking mechanism, thereby collaborating to complete tasks. The main concepts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task: a task can be as simple as an idea, initialized by an inception prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI User: the agent who is expected to provide instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI Assistant: the agent who is expected to respond with solutions that fulfill the instructions."

      "1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). It's recommended to install the latest version of Python 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): This helps to manage dependencies for different projects separately. You can use `venv` or `conda` for this purpose.\n",

      "   conda activate trading_bot_env\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "3. **Install Required Libraries**: Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the necessary libraries using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "   ```python\n",
      "   import pandas as pd\n",

      "5. **Create a Jupyter Notebook** (optional): For an interactive environment, you might want to install Jupyter Notebook. You can do this by running:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install notebook\n",

      "1. **Logging Configuration**: The `logging.basicConfig` function is used to configure the logging settings:\n",
      "   - `filename='trading_bot.log'`: Specifies the log file name.\n",
      "   - `level=logging.INFO`: Sets the logging level to INFO, meaning it will capture all messages at this level and above (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
      "   - `format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'`: Defines the format of the log messages, including the timestamp, log level, and message.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Error Handling in `get_real_time_price`**: The function fetches the current price and logs the result. If an error occurs, it logs the error message.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Logging Trading Decisions**: The `trading_decision` function logs the action taken based on the current price, whether it hits the stop-loss, take-profit, or holds.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Main Loop**: The main loop continuously fetches the current price and makes trading decisions, logging each action.\n",

      "Solution: To test the trading bot with a simulated trading environment and evaluate its performance before deploying it in a live market, we can use the `Backtrader` framework. Backtrader is a powerful backtesting library that allows you to simulate trading strategies using historical data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how to set up a basic backtesting environment using Backtrader:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Backtrader**: If you haven't installed Backtrader yet, you can do so using pip. Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   pip install backtrader\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create a Backtesting Strategy**: We will define a simple trading strategy that uses the stop-loss and take-profit logic we discussed earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run the Backtest**: We will load historical data and run the backtest to evaluate the strategy's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a complete example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",

      "1. **Strategy Definition**: The `MyStrategy` class defines the trading strategy:\n",

      "   - If already in a position, it checks the current price against the stop-loss and take-profit levels and sells if either condition is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cerebro Engine**: The `Cerebro` engine is created to manage the backtesting process:\n",
      "   - Historical data for AAPL is downloaded using `yfinance` and fed into Backtrader using `bt.feeds.PandasData`.\n",
      "   - The trading strategy is added to the Cerebro engine.\n",
      "   - The initial cash for the backtest is set to $10,000.\n",
