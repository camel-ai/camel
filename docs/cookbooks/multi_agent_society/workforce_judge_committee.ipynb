Traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to education often fail to meet the unique needs of individual learners, leading to gaps in understanding and reduced engagement. Our project leverages CAMEL-AI's advanced capabilities to create a highly adaptive, intelligent tutoring system that can understand and respond to each student's learning style, pace, and knowledge gaps in real-time.\n",
