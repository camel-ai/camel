## üìã Overview

This cookbook demonstrates how to create a collaborative multi-agent society using CAMEL-AI, bringing together Claude 4 and Azure OpenAI models to research AI alignment topics from the ARENA curriculum.

Our society consists of 4 specialized AI researchers with distinct personas and expertise areas.

## So, Let's catapault our way right in üßö

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies and Setup
First, let's install the required dependencies and handle the notebook environment:


```python
!pip install camel-ai['0.2.64'] anthropic
```


```python
import textwrap
import os
from getpass import getpass
from typing import Dict, Any

from camel.agents import ChatAgent
from camel.messages import BaseMessage
from camel.models import ModelFactory
from camel.models.azure_openai_model import AzureOpenAIModel
from camel.tasks import Task
from camel.toolkits import FunctionTool, SearchToolkit
from camel.types import ModelPlatformType, ModelType
from camel.societies.workforce import Workforce
```

Prepare API keys: Azure OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), and optionally Google Search



```python
# Ensuring API Keys are set
if not os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  print("AZURE OPENAI API KEY is required to proceed.")
  azure_openai_api_key = getpass("Enter your Azure OpenAI API Key: ")
  os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = azure_openai_api_key

if not os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"):
  print("Azure OpenAI Endpoint is required to proceed.")
  azure_openai_endpoint = input("Enter your Azure OpenAI Endpoint: ")
  os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = azure_openai_endpoint

if not os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"):
  print("ANTHROPIC API KEY is required to proceed.")
  anthropic_api_key = getpass("Enter your Anthropic API Key: ")
  os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = anthropic_api_key

optional_keys_setup = input("Setup optional API Keys for Google search functionality?(y/n): ").lower()

if "y" in optional_keys_setup:
  if not os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"):
    print("[OPTIONAL] Provide a GOOGLE CLOUD API KEY for google search.")
    google_api_key = getpass("Enter your Google API KEY: ")
    os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = google_api_key

  if not os.getenv("SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"):
    print("[OPTIONAL] Provide a search engine ID for google search.")
    search_engine_id = getpass("Enter your Search Engine ID: ")
    os.environ["SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"] = search_engine_id

```

### What this does:

- Imports all necessary CAMEL-AI components
- Handles async operations for notebook environments
- Sets up typing hints for better code clarity


## üèóÔ∏è Core Society Class Structure
Let's define our main research society class:


```python
class ARENAResearchSociety:
    """
    A collaborative CAMEL society between Claude 4 and Azure OpenAI
    for researching the ARENA AI alignment curriculum.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.workforce = None
        self.setup_api_keys()
```

### What this does:

- Creates the main class that will orchestrate our AI research society
- Initializes with API key setup to ensure proper authentication
- Prepares the workforce variable for later agent assignment

## üîë API Configuration Management
Configure all necessary API keys and endpoints:


```python
def setup_api_keys(self):
    """Setup API keys for Azure OpenAI and Claude"""
    print("üîß Setting up API keys...")

    # Azure OpenAI configuration
    if not os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"):
        azure_api_key = getpass("Please input your Azure OpenAI API key: ")
        os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = azure_api_key

    if not os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"):
        azure_endpoint = getpass("Please input your Azure OpenAI endpoint: ")
        os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] = azure_endpoint

    if not os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"):
        deployment_name = getpass("Please input your Azure deployment name (e.g., div-o4-mini): ")
        os.environ["AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"] = deployment_name

    # Set OPENAI_API_KEY for compatibility (use Azure key)
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")

    # Claude API configuration
    if not os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"):
        claude_api_key = getpass("Please input your Claude API key: ")
        os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = claude_api_key

    # Optional: Google Search for research capabilities
    if not os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"):
        try:
            google_api_key = getpass("Please input your Google API key (optional, press Enter to skip): ")
            if google_api_key:
                os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = google_api_key
                search_engine_id = getpass("Please input your Search Engine ID: ")
                if search_engine_id:  # Only set if provided
                    os.environ["SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"] = search_engine_id
                else:
                    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Search Engine ID not provided. Search functionality will be disabled.")
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Skipping Google Search setup...")

    print("‚úÖ API keys configured!")
ARENAResearchSociety.setup_api_keys = setup_api_keys
```

### What this does:

- Securely collects API credentials using getpass (hidden input)
- Supports Azure OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), and optional Google Search
- Sets environment variables for seamless integration
- Provides graceful fallbacks for optional components

## ü§ñ Azure OpenAI Agent Creation
Create specialized Azure OpenAI agents with custom personas:


```python
def create_azure_agent(self, role_name: str, persona: str, specialization: str) -> ChatAgent:
    """Create an Azure OpenAI agent with specific role and persona"""

    msg_content = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are {role_name}, a researcher specializing in AI alignment and safety.

    Your persona: {persona}

    Your specialization: {specialization}

    You are part of a collaborative research team studying the ARENA AI alignment curriculum.
    ARENA focuses on practical AI safety skills including:
    - Mechanistic interpretability

    2. Reference specific ARENA modules when relevant
    3. Build upon other agents' findings
    4. Maintain academic rigor while being accessible
    5. Always cite sources and provide evidence for claims
    """).strip()

    sys_msg = BaseMessage.make_assistant_message(
        role_name=role_name,
        content=msg_content,
    )

    # Configure Azure OpenAI model with correct API version for o4-mini
    model = AzureOpenAIModel(
        model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
        api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        url=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
        api_version="2025-01-01-preview",  # Updated to support o4-mini
        azure_deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME") or "div-o4-mini"
    )

    return ChatAgent(
        system_message=sys_msg,
        model=model,
    )
ARENAResearchSociety.create_azure_agent = create_azure_agent
```

### What this does:

- Creates customizable Azure OpenAI agents with specific roles and expertise
- Embeds ARENA curriculum knowledge into each agent's system prompt
- Uses the latest API version compatible with o4-mini model
- Returns a fully configured ChatAgent ready for collaboration

## üß† Claude Agent Creation
Create Claude agents with complementary capabilities:


```python
def create_claude_agent(self, role_name: str, persona: str, specialization: str, tools=None) -> ChatAgent:
    """Create a Claude agent with specific role and persona"""

    msg_content = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are {role_name}, a researcher specializing in AI alignment and safety.

    Your persona: {persona}

    Your specialization: {specialization}

    You are part of a collaborative research team studying the ARENA AI alignment curriculum.
    ARENA focuses on practical AI safety skills including:
    - Mechanistic interpretability

    3. Synthesize information from multiple perspectives
    4. Ask probing questions to deepen understanding
    5. Connect concepts across different AI safety domains
    """).strip()  # Remove trailing whitespace

    sys_msg = BaseMessage.make_assistant_message(
        role_name=role_name,
        content=msg_content,
    )

    # Configure Claude model
    model = ModelFactory.create(
        model_platform=ModelPlatformType.ANTHROPIC,
        model_type=ModelType.CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET,
    )

    agent = ChatAgent(
        system_message=sys_msg,
        model=model,
        tools=tools or [],
    )

    return agent
ARENAResearchSociety.create_claude_agent = create_claude_agent
```

```python
def create_research_workforce(self):
    """Create the collaborative research workforce"""
    print("üèóÔ∏è Creating ARENA Research Society...")

    # Setup search tools for the lead researcher (only if properly configured)
    search_tools = []
    if os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY") and os.getenv("SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"):
        try:
            search_toolkit = SearchToolkit()
            search_tools = [
                FunctionTool(search_toolkit.search_google),
            ]
            print("üîç Search tools enabled for lead researcher")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Search tools disabled due to configuration issue: {e}")
            search_tools = []
    else:
        print("üîç Search tools disabled - missing API keys")

    # Create Claude agents
    claude_lead = self.create_claude_agent(
        role_name="Dr. Claude Alignment",
        persona="A thoughtful, methodical researcher who excels at synthesizing complex information and identifying key insights. Known for asking the right questions and seeing the bigger picture. Works with existing knowledge when search tools are unavailable.",
        specialization="AI safety frameworks, mechanistic interpretability, and curriculum analysis",
        tools=search_tools
    )

    claude_ethicist = self.create_claude_agent(

        specialization="RLHF implementation, robustness techniques, and technical deep-dives"
    )

    azure_practical = self.create_azure_agent(
        role_name="Dr. Azure Practical",
        persona="A pragmatic researcher focused on real-world applications and practical implementation. Bridges theory with practice.",
        specialization="Practical AI safety applications, training methodologies, and hands-on exercises"
    )

    # Configure coordinator and task agents to use Azure OpenAI with correct API version
    coordinator_agent_kwargs = {
        'model': AzureOpenAIModel(
            model_type=ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
            api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            url=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
            api_version="2025-01-01-preview",
            azure_deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME") or "div-o4-mini"
        ),

            azure_deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME") or "div-o4-mini"
        ),
        'token_limit': 16000
    }

    # Create the workforce with proper configuration
    self.workforce = Workforce(
        'ARENA AI Alignment Research Society',
        coordinator_agent_kwargs=coordinator_agent_kwargs,
        task_agent_kwargs=task_agent_kwargs
    )

    # Add agents with descriptive roles
    self.workforce.add_single_agent_worker(
        'Dr. Claude Alignment (Lead Researcher) - Synthesizes information, leads research direction, and provides comprehensive analysis based on existing knowledge',
        worker=claude_lead,

    if not self.workforce:
        self.create_research_workforce()

    print(f"üî¨ Starting collaborative research on: {research_topic}")
    print("=" * 60)

    task = self.create_research_task(research_topic, specific_questions)
    processed_task = self.workforce.process_task(task)

    print("\n" + "=" * 60)
    print("üìä RESEARCH RESULTS")
    print("=" * 60)
    print(processed_task.result)

    return processed_task.result
ARENAResearchSociety.run_research = run_research

            result = society.run_research(
                topic_info["topic"],
                topic_info["questions"]
            )
      elif choice == '4':
            custom_topic = input("Enter your research topic: ").strip()
            custom_questions = input("Enter specific questions (optional): ").strip()
            result = society.run_research(
                custom_topic,
                custom_questions if custom_questions else None
            )
      else:
            print("Invalid choice. Running default research...")
            result = society.run_research(sample_topics[1]["topic"], sample_topics[1]["questions"])

except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nüëã Research session interrupted.")
