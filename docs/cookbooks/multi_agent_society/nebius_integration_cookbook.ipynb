            "**Multi‚ÄëAgent Systems (MAS)** are collections of autonomous, interacting software or robotic entities that perceive their environment, make decisions, and act to achieve individual or collective goals. Over the last two decades, MAS have become a cornerstone of many AI applications. Below are the core benefits that make them attractive, along with concrete examples of where each advantage shines.\n",
            "\n",
            "| # | Benefit | What It Means | Typical Use‚ÄëCase | Why It Matters |\n",
            "|---|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------|\n",
            "| 1 | **Scalability & Parallelism** | Agents can operate concurrently, distributing workload across many cores or nodes. | ‚Ä¢ Distributed search (e.g., web crawling, protein folding). <br>‚Ä¢ Multi‚Äërobot exploration (search‚Äëand‚Äërescue). | Large‚Äëscale problems that would stall a single process can be tackled by a swarm of lightweight agents, each doing a piece of the job. |\n",
            "| 2 | **Modularity & Composability** | Each agent encapsulates a specific function or knowledge base, making the system easier to design, extend, and maintain. | ‚Ä¢ Smart‚Äëcity traffic control: separate agents for traffic lights, vehicles, and pedestrians. <br>‚Ä¢ Modular game AI: separate agents for path‚Äëfinding, strategy, and dialogue. | New features or changes can be added by swapping or updating a single agent without touching the whole system. |\n",
            "| 3 | **Robustness & Fault Tolerance** | Failure of one agent does not collapse the entire system; other agents can compensate or take over. | ‚Ä¢ Autonomous drone fleets: if one drone crashes, others continue the mission. <br>‚Ä¢ Cloud‚Äëbased micro‚Äëservices: failing service instances are replaced by new ones. | Critical for safety‚Äëcritical or mission‚Äëcritical applications where downtime is unacceptable. |\n",
            "| 4 | **Decentralized Decision‚ÄëMaking** | No single point of control; agents make local decisions that collectively lead to a global objective. | ‚Ä¢ Swarm robotics (e.g., collective transport, foraging). <br>‚Ä¢ Distributed sensor networks for environmental monitoring. | Enables systems to adapt to dynamic environments and reduces bottlenecks associated with centralized planning. |\n",
            "| 5 | **Specialization & Knowledge Sharing** | Agents can be designed for specific tasks or domains and can share knowledge or negotiate. | ‚Ä¢ Multi‚Äëagent negotiation in e‚Äëcommerce: buyers, sellers, and logistics agents. <br>‚Ä¢ Collaborative learning: agents share learned models or policies. | Allows heterogeneous expertise to coexist, improving overall performance and enabling complex, multi‚Äëobjective solutions. |\n",
            "| 6 | **Learning & Adaptation** | Agents can learn from experience (reinforcement, imitation, transfer learning) and adapt to new conditions. | ‚Ä¢ Autonomous driving: agents learn safe driving policies in simulation before deployment. <br>‚Ä¢ Adaptive cybersecurity: agents learn new attack patterns and adjust defenses. | Continuous improvement without human re‚Äëprogramming; crucial for dynamic, uncertain environments. |\n",
            "| 7 | **Human‚ÄëCentric Interaction** | Agents can model human preferences, negotiate, and provide explainable, socially‚Äëaware behaviors. | ‚Ä¢ Personal assistants that coordinate calendars, budgets, and health. <br>‚Ä¢ Collaborative design tools where human designers and AI agents co‚Äëcreate. | Enhances usability and trust, especially in domains where AI must align with human values. |\n",

            "2. **Resilience**  \n",
