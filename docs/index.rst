Welcome to CAMEL's documentation!
=================================
| **Finding the Scaling Law of Agents: The First and the Best Multi-Agent Framework.**

| **CAMEL** was the first `LLM-based multi-agent framework <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17760.pdf>`_ and has since evolved into a general-purpose framework for building and deploying LLM-based agents to solve real-world tasks. We believe that studying these agents at scale offers valuable insights into their behaviors, capabilities, and potential risks. To facilitate research in this field, we support a wide range of agents, tasks, prompts, models, and simulated environments.
